The cytostome lies at the base of the reservoir and joins a cytopharynx. A contractile vacuole discharges into the reservoir in freshwater species, and two flagella, each bearing a row of mastigonemes, arise from the reservoir wall. In Euglena, one flagellum is very short and terminates at the base of the long flagellum. A pigmented eyespot, or stigma, shades a photosensitive bulge, the paraflagellar body, at the base of the long flagellum. In the colorless heterotroph Peranema, both flagella are long, but one trails backward and can be used to catch food or temporarily attach to something. The long locomotory flagellum is thickened, up to five times the normal flagellar diameter, and stiffened along most of its length by a paraxial rod located to one side of the axoneme. Only the mobile terminal end of the flagellum lacks the rod.",

All share the flagellar paraxial rod with their euglenoid relatives, but uniquely have a conspicuous mass of DNA, called a kinetoplast, located within a single, large mitochondrion. Most of the kinetoplast DNA sequences code for the morphogenesis of mitochondria. The large kinetoplast genome probably is related to the cyclical differentiation and regression of mitochondria as parasitic kinetoplastids adapt their energy metabolism to alternating aerobic and anaerobic host environments. The one or two flagella arise from a reservoir-like pit, which bears a cytostome that leads into a cytopharynx. Their basal bodies are located on or near the kinetoplast mitochondrion.",

Apicomplex ans also are responsible for malaria, the number-one parasitic disease of humankind, as well as similar debilitating diseases of livestock. Apicomplexans are so named because motile infective stages (sporozoites, merozoites) bear an anterior apical complex that attaches to or penetrates into host cells. A fully developed apical complex consists of an anterior conoid, one or two polar rings, 2 to 20 flask-shaped glandular structures (rhoptries),and numerous membranous Golgi-derivedtubules (micronemes). The conoid is open at both ends and encircled by the polar rings, which link to subpellicular microtubules. The micronemes contain enzymes presumably used for host-cell penetration, but the functions of the other components are unclear. Apicomplexans lack cilia, but fla- gella occur on their microgametes. Pseudopodia also are absent. Infective stages move by gliding, which may result from microscopic undulations of the pellicle. One or more feeding pores, called micropores, are located on the side of the body. The apicomplexan pellicle consists of the outer cell membrane and two additional membranes below it. The two inner membranes are actually the outer and inner walls of a flattened alveolus, which completely encloses the subpellicular cytoplasm except for breaks anteriorly (api- cal complex), laterally (micropores), and posteriorly (site of exocytosis).",

The worms elicit feelings of revulsion but engage our morbid curiosity, and deserve admiration for their adaptive success. These parasites, which include flukes, tapeworms, and their relatives, are biologically remarkable animals. Most are endoparasites and many colonize a succession of different hosts in different environments before they complete their life cycle. Not only must they adjust physiologically to life in each of these abiotic and host environments, but also locate and infect each new host. Their fascinating biology is related to how they meet these challenges. From the standpoint of human ecology, these worms attack and debilitate economically important wild life and domestic animals, and humans themselves.

Many live in shallow coastal waters, where they cling tenaciously in powerful surf and surge. About half of modern species live in the intertidal or shallow subtidal zones. Other species are found in deeper, quieter water. The elongate, oval body is strongly depressed dorsoventrally. Chitons are distinctive in having a shell composed of eight overlapping plates, which permits flexibility in conforming to the shape of the irregular, rocky substratum. Chitons lack cephalic eyes or tentacles and the head is poorly developed and indistinct. The mantle is thick and the foot is broad and flat to facilitate adhesion to hard substrates.",

The gastropod fossil record begins in the early Cambrian period and extends unbroken to the present. No other molluscan class has experienced the extraordinary adaptive radiation seen in the gastropods during this period. Gastropods originated in the sea, but have colonized fresh water and are the only mol- luscs found in terrestrial habitats. Among metazoan animals, only the vertebrates, crustaceans, and perhaps the annelids have enjoyed similar success in all three major environments. Estimates of the number of species vary widely from 40,000 to 100,000 species, but there are probably around 60,000 described, extant gastropods and another 15,000 known fossil species. Gastropods are primarily benthic and have become adapted to life on all types of bottoms, but some are adapted to a pelagic life. The pulmonate snails and slugs, as well as several other groups, have conquered land by eliminating the gills and converting the mantle cavity into a lung. Three major groups, the prosobranchs, pulmonates, and opisthobranchs, have tended to specialize along different lines. The prosobranchs are primarily benthic marine animals, whereas pulmonates have capitalized on the ecological possibilities of aerial respiration and opisthobranchs have experimented with the advantages of losing the shell.",

Scaphopods inhabit a tubular shell with an opening at each end and have a radula but lack gills. Like bivalves, they are bilaterally symmetrical and have a foot adapted for digging. Scaphopods live buried in sand, head downward and with the body steeply inclined. The small, posterior aperture usually projects slightly above the surface, but sometimes the animal may be completely buried to up to 30cm deep in the sediment. The majority of scaphopods are microcarnivores that burrow in sand at depths greater than 6m and up to 7000m. Although relatively common, they are not often encountered in shallow water, although at least one species occurs in the low intertidal. Empty shells often wash ashore on some coasts.",

The cephalothorax is completely covered by a carapace that bears a pair of anterior median eyes and three or four pairs of lateral eyes. Uropygid chelicerae are small and have two articles. The distal article forms a fang that folds against the large basal article. The large, raptorial pedipalps are stout and heavy, and short in comparison with the legs. The last two articles of the pedipalps may be modified to form a pincer used in seizing prey. During feeding, the prey is seized and torn apart by the pedipalps and then passed to the chelicerae. The animal holds its pedipalps and long, tactile first legs in front as it moves forward. The antenniform, sensory first legs touch the ground repeatedly.",

Approximately 40,000 species in about 100 families and 3000 genera have been described, and it has been estimated that there are probably at least 170,000 species alive in the world today. Spider population densities can be very large, and in one study a hectare of undisturbed, grassy meadow in Great Britain was found to support over 5 million spiders. The great success of spiders relative to other arachnids probably results from their innovative use of silk. Many aspects of spider biology depend on silk, and it may be the adaptive equivalent of flight by insects in that both innovations resulted in extensive adaptive radiation culminating in great diversity. Spiders are, with few exceptions, terrestrial and occur on all continents except Antarctica. They are found in most terrestrial habitats but are absent from the sea, and there is only one freshwater species that lives below the water surface. Spiders are easily distinguished from most other arachnid orders by the distinctive pedicel between the cephalothorax and abdomen. Spiders are also the only arachnids with silk-spinning appendages, the spinnerets, on the posterior abdomen. Spiders are strictly carnivorous.",

In the United States, a few species have been found in Florida and more than 100 have been found in the southwest, some as far north as Colorado. Many solifuges are common in warm, arid regions of the world, but they are also known from grasslands and forests. Solifuges hide under stones and in crevices and many dig burrows. Their length ranges from a few millimeters to as much as 7 cm. The cephalothorax is covered dorsally by a large anterior carapace bearing a pair of closely placed median eyes on the anterior border and a short posterior carapace, or tergum. The hinge between the anterior and posterior carapaces is flexible. The segmented abdomen is large and joined to the cephalothorax by a slightly narrowed waist.",

They do not produce silk or toxins and they do not bite, although they may (rarely) pinch. The widespread belief that harvestmen have a highly toxic venom is due to their being confused with pholcid spiders, which also go by the name “daddy longlegs.” These spiders resemble harvestmen but have a potent toxin, although their chelicerae are too small and weak to envenomate humans. Most harvestmen are predators but, unlike almost all other arachnids, many are herbivores, and many feed on dead organic material. Also unlike other arachnids, they are capable of ingesting particulate food. In fact, since the pharynx pedipalps and passed to the chelicerae, which hold and crush it.

They inhabit a rigid calcareous shell (carapace or mantle) that grows without molting, many are hermaphroditic, and they are sessile. Barnacles have features in common with ostracod sand, in fact, resemble an ostracod turned upside down and stuck firmly to the substratum by its head and back. Cirripedes include the only nonparasitic sessile crustaceans, and their anatomy and biology have undergone extensive modifications as a consequence of this unique lifestyle.",

Unlike most fish, however, lancelets burrow in porous intertidal or shallow subtidal sand and rarely emerge to swim in the water. While in their burrows, they expose the mouth to water at the sediment surface and filter out suspended food particles. Although widespread globally, their patchy local distributions are influenced by sediment suitability and the abundance of phytoplankton food. When these conditions are met, lancelet populations can be impressive. For example, Branchiosioma caribaeum occurs in densities of up to 5000 individuals per m2 of sand in Discovery Bay, Jamaica.",
