    "TEXT": "The euglenoid species of Peranema and Euglena are among the most familiar of all flagellates. The body is elongate with an invagination, the reservoir, at the anterior end. The cytostome lies at the base of the reservoir and joins a cytopharynx. A contractile vacuole discharges into the reservoir in freshwater species, and two flagella, each bearing a row of mastigonemes, arise from the reservoir wall. In Euglena, one flagellum is very short and terminates at the base of the long flagellum. A pigmented eyespot, or stigma, shades a photosensitive bulge, the paraflagellar body, at the base of the long flagellum. In the colorless heterotroph Peranema, both flagella are long, but one trails backward and can be used to catch food or temporarily attach to something. The long locomotory flagellum is thickened, up to five times the normal flagellar diameter, and stiffened along most of its length by a paraxial rod located to one side of the axoneme. Only the mobile terminal end of the flagellum lacks the rod.",

All share the flagellar paraxial rod with their euglenoid relatives, but uniquely have a conspicuous mass of DNA, called a kinetoplast, located within a single, large mitochondrion. Most of the kinetoplast DNA sequences code for the morphogenesis of mitochondria. The large kinetoplast genome probably is related to the cyclical differentiation and regression of mitochondria as parasitic kinetoplastids adapt their energy metabolism to alternating aerobic and anaerobic host environments. The one or two flagella arise from a reservoir-like pit, which bears a cytostome that leads into a cytopharynx. Their basal bodies are located on or near the kinetoplast mitochondrion.",

The cylindrical body is more or less radially symmetric, except during some bilateral developmental stages. The compact body lacks gut, coelom, hemal system, nephridia, and neurons, and most species also lack muscle. The body wall consists solely of a monolayered, multiciliated epidermis around a core of one to several cells, including stem cells. The epidermis functions in locomotion and host nutrient uptake whereas the interior cells are reproductive. Mesozoan life cycles are complex, diverse, and, in most cases, not fully documented.",

Ascothoracida has crustacean-like males and aberrant females, and is the sister taxon of Cirripedia. The thecostracan larval compound eye has a three-part crystalline cone formed by three cone cells. Compound eyes are absent in adults and the second antennae are vestigial or absent. The first antennae are attachment organs and the carapace tends to be large and bivalved unless it has been secondarily lost. Adults are usually sessile, and commensalism and parasitism have arisen several times. An abdomen is present in only the most primitive taxa. Development includes distinctive nauplius and cypris larvae. Ascothoracidans are the most primitive thecostracans. Rhizocephalans are the most derived and look nothing like crustaceans. A fifth thecostracan taxon, the enigmatic Facetotecta, has been known since 1899 from cosmopolitan, planktonic “Y-larvae,” both nauplii and cyprids, for which adults have never been found. The cyprids of all thecostracan higher taxa have five pairs of chemosensory lattice organs on the carapace, each consisting of a noval cuticular plate penetrated by a large terminal pore and sometimes by a field of tiny pores.

Called arrow worms, their slender, shaft like bodies bear horizontal fins reminiscent of those on a torpedo or the feathered vanes of an arrow. The body is characteristically straight and stiff, except during sudden swimming bursts, which thrust the animal to a new location in the blink of an eye. Like an arrow shot from a bow, they reach the zenith of their flight, arc downward headfirst, and gradually descend. It is during the slow descent that they have the opportunity to detect the swimming vibrations of their prey, mostly small crustaceans, which they grasp and devour. Although most chaetognaths are adapted to life in the plankton, some are benthic animals that attach to macroalgae and seize passing prey. All of the approximately 150 species of Chaetognatha are marine. They reach their highest diversity in the tropics, but are common in all oceans worldwide. Most arrow worms are 1 to 2 cm long, but species range in size from a few millimeters to 12 cm (Pseudosagitta gazellae). The sister taxon of chaetognaths has not yet been determined, but recent evidence indicates that they are prostostomes, perhaps allied with molting anifhals (Ecdysozoa).",

This diverticulum, called astomochord, was previously regarded as a rudimentary notochord, a trait associated with Chordata, among which are the vertebrates. In addition to this notochord-like structure, hemichordates also express two other traits typical of chordates. The first is one or more pairs of gill slits, the general name for perforations of the pharyngeal wall, regardless of shape, which extend through the body wall and open to the exterior. The second is the so called collar cord (neurocord), a short section of sometimes hollow dorsal nerve cord reminiscent of the chordate dorsal hollow nerve cord (spinal cord). The hemichordate gill slits are probably homologous to those of chordates and may even be part of the deuterostome ground plan, but the collar cord and stomo chord are likely unique to hemichordates.We will return to these evolutionary issues later in the chapter.",
