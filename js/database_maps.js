		"phylum": "PROTOZOA",
		"text": "Formerly known as infusoria or animalcules, protozoans are motile, eukaryotic, unicellular organisms. United by the common possession of motility, an attribute that undoubtedly evolved independency in many groups, protozoa is a polyphyletic taxon with an unclear boundary. Historically, protozoa included nearly every group of what we now consider Protista— fungus-like, animal-like, plant-like, and other unicellular eukaryotes. The name protozoa means “first animals,” and it was natural for early biologists to seek the ancestor of Metazoa (animals) from among the free-moving protists. But it has now been established that only one protozoan taxon, the collared flagellates (Choanoflagellata), is the sister taxon of Metazoa and truly qualifies as the “first animal.” The remaining protozoan taxa are either unique groups with no significant multi-cellular descendants or they are related closely to plants or fungi. Remarkably, one protozoan taxon, Myxozoa (formerly Myxosporidia), is actually a group of animals related to cnidarians (anemones and jellyfishes). Thus protozoa is the name for a grade within a scheme of organization, a loose confederation of eukaryotic taxa, rather than for a monophyletic taxon. Protists exhibit astounding diversity and play a significant ecological role. The nearly 215,000 described species equal in number the vascular plants and are10 times more plentiful than the number of bacterial and viral species combined. Of the total number of protist species, slightly less than half(around 92,000) are protozoans, one-quarter of which live as symbionts of other organisms. Protozoan parasites, for example, have an enormous impact on humans: Millions of people die yearly from malaria and other parasitic protozoans, and protozoans that sicken and kill livestock, poultry, fish, and wildlife cost economies several hundred million dollars annually. But the other face of protozoan ecology is beneficial. The mutualism between photosynthetic protozoans and corals underlies the coral-reef ecosystem, one of the most diverse on earth. Myriads occupy aquatic environments and soils and play essential roles in food chains, including the control of bacterial populations and the recycling of nutrients. The protists as a whole, including the photosynthetic protozoa, account for 40% of global primary productivity. ",

The attached, often upright sponges are to coral reefs, sea grottoes, and floats what stalagmites and stalactites are to terrestrial limestone caves, except that sponge colors are as vivid and varied as those of Van Gogh’s flowers. When we look at sponges underwater in tropical seas, it seems a stretch to admit these motionless organisms with their irregular, often branched bodies to the pantheon of animals. Yet despite their superficial similarity to plants, they are indeed animals, but, like plants, they capture and concentrate dilute resources using their large surface area. Instead of relying on leaves and roots to trap light, C02, and water for photosynthesis, sponges have expanded their surfaces to catch the organic food particles suspended in seawater. Other, higher metazoans also evolved the ability to suspension feed, but sponges were surely the first to do so, and they continue to enjoy undiminished success. This chapter explores the functional design and diversity of these strange but engaging animals.",

Cnidaria includes fleshy polyps— graceful freshwater hydras, colorful sea anemones, sculptured stony corals, plant likes of t corals, and weedy hydroids—as well as medusae, or jelly fishes, whose pulsating bells resembled is embodied hearts. Many cnidarians, corals for example, are colonies that undergo modular growth and may reach several meters in size. Solitary individuals also can be large, like the jellyfish Cyaneacapillata (lion’s mane jelly), which is reported to reach 2m in diameter, or the 1.25-m-wide anemone Stichodactyla mertensii from Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. The stony corals, with their massive skeletons and photosynthetic zooxanthellae, are the foundation of the coral-reef community, one of the most spectacular ecosystems on earth. Coral reefs are rivaled in diversity only by tropical rainforests, but the reef outstrips the rainforest in color and activity, as well as in the taxonomic range of animals present. Cnidarian diversity reaches it zenith on coral reefs, but cnidarians are widespread and common worldwide in shallow seas, where they attach to hard objects, burrow in sediments, or drift in the plankton. Of the approximately 10,000 known species, only 20 occur in fresh water; the remainder are marine. Historically, cnidarians were classified alone, or with ctenophores, as Coelenterata, but most zoologists no longer accept this group. Fossil cnidarians are known from the Precambrian period, and a rich fossil record dates from the Cambrian.",

Ctenophores are voracious predators of zooplankton, such as crustaceans, jellyfish, fish eggs, and often each other. Of the approximately 80 species, several are seasonally abundant in coastal waters and thus play an important role in the planktonic food web. The transparent, fragile body is generally spherical or egg-shaped and superficially resembles that of some cnidarian jellyfish. Similar to jellyfish, the main axis of the body is oral-aboral and the mesoglea is thick and buoyant. But ctenophores differ from jellyfish in two striking ways: They use cilia instead of muscles for locomotion and they lack cnidae. Because of these differences and some unique attributes of their own, ctenophores are classified separately from cnidarians. Historically, however, ctenophores and cnidarians were combined in the now defunct taxon Coelenterata, although the informal term “coelenterate” continues to be used in reference to both taxa.",

As compared with sponges, cnidarians, and ctenophores, bilaterians enjoy an unparalleled diversity and adaptive success. They account for over 99% of all animal species and have radiated and flourished in the sea, in fresh water, on land, in air, and recently one species, our own, has entered outer space. Their sweep of adult body sizes extends from less than 100pm, the size range of larger protozoans, to 15 m (giant squid) and beyond 30 m (blue whale). In general, the microscopic species are of simple design, some not exceeding the tissue level of organization, while many large- bodied forms have multiple organs and complex organ systems. The astonishing range of body size and complexity, moreover, includes both solitary and colonial growth forms, the latter achieving complexity through zooid polymorphism. Unique to bilaterians is the evolution of social behavior, which emerged independently in insects and vertebrates, and con- tributes to their success. The potential of social organization was further realized some 10,000 years ago when humans established a mutualism—agriculture—with plants and animals and developed civilization.",

The length record of 180 feet (54 m) is held by a boot-lace worm, Lineus longissimus, the longest animal on Earth, that washed ashore after a storm in St. Andrews, Scotland. Nemerteans commonly burrow in marine sediments, lurk (or lie in tangles) in crevices among shells, stones, and the rootlike hold- fasts of algae and sessile animals, but some are deepwater pelagic species with gelatinous bodies. Others form semipermanent burrows lined with mucus or even produce unique cellophane-like tubes. A few species live as ectosymbionts on crabs, in the mantle cavity of bivalve molluscs, or in the atrium of tunicates. Approximately 12 species occur in fresh water and some 15 terrestrial species are confined primarily to the humid tropics and subtropics. The relatively few animals that eat nemerteans include bottom-feeding fishes, some shore birds, and other invertebrates such as horseshoe crabs, as well as fellow nemerteans. Two large ribbon worms, the North American Cerebratulus lacteus and the South African Polybrachiorhynchus dayi, known locally as “tapeworms,” are collected and sold as fish bait.

Annelid diversity manifests itself in many ways, but none is more obvious than the manner in which annelids feed. Virtually all feeding modes—suspension feeding, deposit feeding, scavenging, herbivory, carnivory—are represented in annelids. A few annelids are important to humans as an in direct source of food, including earthworms (and marine relatives) used as fish bait, to till soil, and to convert organic matter to compost, thus improving soil fertility.

		"text": "Chordata, with more than 50,000 species in all of Earth’s environments, is the largest and most successful taxon of deuterostomes. Most of this diversity and adaptive radiation resides with Vertebrata (fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals), a major chordate taxon beyond the scope of this book. The subjects of this chapter are the two other chordate taxa, Cephalochordata (lancelets) and Tunicata (= Urochordata; sea squirts and relatives), both of which are invertebrates and entirely marine. These two taxa of invertebrate chordates account for approximately 2180 species. Although the vertebrates are omitted as a practical necessity, this chapter will highlight the chordate ground plan and its evolution in the invertebrate chordates.",
