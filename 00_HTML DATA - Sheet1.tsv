001	EUGLENOIDEA	PROTOZOA	EUGLENOZOA		EUGLENOIDEA						The euglenoid species of Peranema and Euglena are among the most familiar of all flagellates. The body is elongate with an invagination, the reservoir, at the anterior end. The cytostome lies at the base of the reservoir and joins a cytopharynx. A contractile vacuole discharges into the reservoir in freshwater species, and two flagella, each bearing a row of mastigonemes, arise from the reservoir wall. In Euglena, one flagellum is very short and terminates at the base of the long flagellum. A pigmented eyespot, or stigma, shades a photosensitive bulge, the paraflagellar body, at the base of the long flagellum. In the colorless heterotroph Peranema, both flagella are long, but one trails backward and can be used to catch food or temporarily attach to something. The long locomotory flagellum is thickened, up to five times the normal flagellar diameter, and stiffened along most of its length by a paraxial rod located to one side of the axoneme. Only the mobile terminal end of the flagellum lacks the rod.	
002	KINETOPLASTIDA	PROTOZOA	EUGLENOZOA		KINETOPLASTIDA						Kinetoplastid flagellates are colorless heterotrophs. A few of the 600 species are free living, but most are important parasites. All share the flagellar paraxial rod with their euglenoid relatives, but uniquely have a conspicuous mass of DNA, called a kinetoplast, located within a single, large mitochondrion. Most of the kinetoplast DNA sequences code for the morphogenesis of mitochondria. The large kinetoplast genome probably is related to the cyclical differentiation and regression of mitochondria as parasitic kinetoplastids adapt their energy metabolism to alternating aerobic and anaerobic host environments. The one or two flagella arise from a reservoir-like pit, which bears a cytostome that leads into a cytopharynx. Their basal bodies are located on or near the kinetoplast mitochondrion.	
003	VOLVOCIDA	PROTOZOA	CHLOROPHYTA		VOLVOCIDA						Volvocida is a taxon of green algae (Chlorophyta), in which the large, cup-shaped chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b and a pyrenoid that synthesizes starch (amylopectin) as a food storage product. Many chlorophytes are nonmotile marine and freshwater algae, such as the filamentous Spirogyra of fresh water. The cells of Volvocida, however, are permanently flagellated: Each cell bears two, four, or occasionally eight flagella lacking mastigonemes. An eyespot and two contractile vacuoles also may be present. The cells are enclosed in a gel matrix composed of glycoproteins and glycoaminoglycans and are inter joined by cytoplasmic bridges.	
004	CHOANOFLAGELLATA	PROTOZOA	CHOANOFLAGELLATA								Surprising as it may seem, the marine and freshwater choanoflagellates are the sister taxon of animals (Metazoa). Both choanoflagellate and primitive monociliated animal cells bear a single flagellum, which bears a bilateral vane of mastigoneme-like filaments and is surrounded by a cylindrical collar of microvilli. This synapomorphy, along with support provided by rDNA sequences, unites the choanoflagellates and metazoans as sister taxa in amonophyletic taxon. The 600 species of choanoflagellates are mostly tiny and inconspicuous, usually not in excess of 10pm in diameter. While feeding, the flagellum creates a water current from which the collar filters bacteria and organic particulates. Bacteria trapped on the collar are ingested by phagocytosis.	
005	RETORTAMONADEA	PROTOZOA	RETORTAMONADA		RETORTAMONADEA						Two or four anterior flagella, one of which is associated with the cytostome, which is elongate longitudinally as a body furrow; mitochondria are absent. Chilomastix sp. (plural, spp.) cause diarrhea in humans, poultry; Retortamonas.	
006	DIPLONADEA	PROTOZOA	RETORTAMONADA		DIPLOMONADEA						Cell with eight flagella, two cytostomes, two nuclei (twinned, diplozoic cell); mitochondria are absent. Free-living Hexamita and parasitic Giardia, with their attachment disc and long flagellar axonemes.	
007	OXYMONADEA	PROTOZOA	RETORTAMONADA		OXYMONADEA						Four posterior flagella; no cytostome, mitochondria, or Golgi bodies. Undulatory axostyle, with intra-cellular bacteria and surface-attached spirochetes. Anaerobes in the gut of termites and wood roaches. Oxymonas, Pyrsonympha.	
008	PARABASALEA	PROTOZOA	RETORTAMONADA		PARABASALEA						Cells have from a few to thousands of flagella and aggregates of large Golgi bodies (parabasal bodies). Axostyleisskeletal, single, replicated, or lost; mitochondria are absent; gut symbionts. Trichomonadida has two to six flagella; a recurrent flagellum forms an undulating membrane; axostyle projects posteriorly to form the attachment site. Trichomonas and Mixotricha paradoxa in the termite gut have surface-attached spirochetes whose motion propels the flagellate. Hypermastigida has many flagella at the anterior end of the cell (sometimes also elsewhere). Most have surface-attached symbiotic bacteria. In the gut of termites and wood roaches. Barbulanympha, Lophomonas, Trichonympha.	
009	ALVEOLATA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA								Three taxa, Dinoflagellata, Ciliophora, and Apicomplexa (Sporozoa) constitute the Alveolata. Alveolates are united on the basis of having similar ribosomal DNA sequences and pellicular alveoli.	
010	DINOFLAGELLATA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	DINOFLAGELLATA							Approximately one-half of the 4000 marine and freshwater species of dinoflagellates have chloroplasts and are important primary producers, especially in the sea. The xanthophyll pigment peridinin colors themred-brown or golden brown.Their chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and have chlorophylls a and c, but lack chlorophyll b. Dinoflagellate chloroplasts are diverse, having originated as endosymbionts from at least three different taxa of photosynthetic cells. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates lack plastids and are colorless. Like euglenoids, dinoflagellates originated as colorless heterotrophs that independency acquired chloroplasts by endosymbiosis, probably more than once. A few dinoflagellates are endoparasites of other protozoans, crustaceans, and fishes. The cell nucleus contains permanently condensed (thickened) chromo- somes having relatively small amounts of protein, and each chromosome is permanently attached to the nuclear membrane.	
011	CILIOPHORA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	CILIOPHORA							Ciliophora is a monophyletic taxon of animated and engaging cell-organisms. Most seem like diminutive animals because of their sophisticated cellular organelles and the complexity of their behavior. Many animal tissues and organs, such as muscle and gut, have analogs in the cellular anatomy of ciliates. The 8000+ described species are widely distributed in fresh water, the sea, and in the water film around soil particles. All ciliates are heterotrophs, but about one-third of them are ecto or endocommensals or parasites.	
012	KARYORELICTEA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	CILIOPHORA	KARYORELICTEA						Freshwater Loxodes and marine interstitial Geleia, Remanella, and Tracheloraphis, ail highly contractile. Macronuclei and micronuclei both diploid; somatic dikinetids.

014	PROSTOMATEA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	CILIOPHORA	PROSTOMATEA						Oral region similar to that of litostomates, but some polykinetids are also present; have somatic monokinetids with radially arranged MT ribbons and a cytostome at the anterior end of the cell; toxicysts are common. Marine and fresh water Coleps, Prorodon.	
015	PHYLLOPHARYNGEA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	CILIOPHORA	PHYLLOPHARYNGEA						Leaflike ribbons of MTs surrounded by longitudinal bundles of MTs that form a basket-shaped cytopharynx (cyrtos); somatic monokinetids. PhyllopharyngiasC, of which Chilodonella is flattened, ciliated ventrally, and found in sewage; ChonotrichiasG, which are sessile, noncili- ated filter feeders with a spiral oral end that attach to crus- taceans; SuctoriasC, which are sessile, cilia-free predators with prey-catching tentacles, resemble miniature sundews and include Allantosoma (in horse colon), Ephelota, Heliophrya, Tokophrya. Marine and fresh water.	
016	NASSOPHOREA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	CILIOPHORA	NASSOPHOREA						Transverse MT ribbons tangential to the basal bodies; well-developed kinetodesma; MT bundles form a complex, basket-shaped cytopharynx (nasse); somatic mono- or dikinetids. Peniculida0 has an oral apparatus that isanelasticslitandthreeoralmembranelles(peniculus)on its left side and an undulating membrane on the right; a nasse is absent; includes the slipper ciliate, Paramecium.	
017	OLIGOHYMENOPHOREA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	CILIOPHORA	OLIGOHYMENOPHOREA						A few oral polykinetids, usually three, on left side of the cytostome; somatic mono kinetid swith MT ribbons that radiate from the basal bodies. Hymenos- tomatiasC, oral apparatus like that of Nassophorea. The best- known ciliate is the free-living Tetrahymena; Ichthyophthirius, the cause of “ich” disease of freshwater fishes; Pleuronema, Uronema. PeritrichiasC, a ciliary ring on its oral rim that winds helically counterclockwise to the cytostome and then splits into three membranelles; somatic cilia are reduced; often have contractile stalks (or bodies) and are mosdy sessile and attached, but some can detach and swim: Carchesium, Epistylis, Trichodina, Urceolaria, Varticella.	
018	COLPODEA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	CILIOPHORA	COLPODEA						Kidney-shaped cells with spiral kineties and somatic dikinetids: Bursaria, Colpoda.	
019	APICOMPLEXA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	APICOMPLEXA							The some 5000 species of apicomplexans are widespread and common parasites of such animals as worms, echinoderms, insects, and vertebrates. Depending on the species, they may be extra- or intracellular parasites or both at different stages of the life cycle. Apicomplex ans also are responsible for malaria, the number-one parasitic disease of humankind, as well as similar debilitating diseases of livestock. Apicomplexans are so named because motile infective stages (sporozoites, merozoites) bear an anterior apical complex that attaches to or penetrates into host cells. A fully developed apical complex consists of an anterior conoid, one or two polar rings, 2 to 20 flask-shaped glandular structures (rhoptries),and numerous membranous Golgi-derivedtubules (micronemes). The conoid is open at both ends and encircled by the polar rings, which link to subpellicular microtubules. The micronemes contain enzymes presumably used for host-cell penetration, but the functions of the other components are unclear. Apicomplexans lack cilia, but fla- gella occur on their microgametes. Pseudopodia also are absent. Infective stages move by gliding, which may result from microscopic undulations of the pellicle. One or more feeding pores, called micropores, are located on the side of the body. The apicomplexan pellicle consists of the outer cell membrane and two additional membranes below it. The two inner membranes are actually the outer and inner walls of a flattened alveolus, which completely encloses the subpellicular cytoplasm except for breaks anteriorly (api- cal complex), laterally (micropores), and posteriorly (site of exocytosis).	
020	GREGARINEA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	APICOMPLEXA	GREGARINEA						Life cycle with one host; multiple fission by both male and female gamonts; constriction separates gamont body into anterior protomerite and posterior deutomerite, with epimerite (such as hooks) at tip of protomerite; gamontcellsunite(syzygy)before encystment and move by gliding; most stages are extracellular parasites ofechinoderms, molluscs, annelids, and especially arthro- pods. Species identification based on epimerite structure. Gregarina, Monocystis.	
021	COCCIDIA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	APICOMPLEXA	COCCIDIA						Each macrogamont forms but one macrogamete; gamonts encyst; most species are intracellular parasites of invertebrates and vertebrates in one or two hosts. Cryp- tosporidium, Eimeria (in poultry), Haemogregarina, Toxoplasma (causes toxoplasmosis in cats and sometimes in humans).	
022	HEMATOZOEA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	APICOMPLEXA	HEMATOZOEA						Blood parasites that alternate between vertebrate(intermediate) and arthropod (final) hosts; sporozoites infect vertebrates and motile micro- and macrogametes are transferred to arthropods; gamonts do not pair or encyst. Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon (causes turkey malaria), Plasmod- ium (causesmalaria).	
023	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	AMEBAS							Amebas (or amebae) may be naked or enclosed in a test. The naked amebas, which include Amoeba, live in the sea, in fresh water, and in the water film around soil particles. The shape, although constantly changing, is characteristic in different species. Some giants, such as Pelomyxa palustris or Chaoscarolinense, can be 5mm in length and are multi nucleated cells. The cytoplasm in amebas is divided into a stiff, clear, external ectoplasm and a more fluid internal endoplasm (Fig. 3-28A). The pseudopodia adopt one of two general forms. Lobopodia, which are typical of many amebas, are wide and rounded with blunt tips. They are commonly tubular and composed of both ectoplasm and endoplasm. Filopodia, which occur in many small amebas, are slender, clear, and sometimes branched, but the branches do not inteijoin extensively to form nets.	
024	CARYOBLASTA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	AMEBAS	CARYOBLASTA						Cell has one to several non motile flagella, each with a basal body from which MTs radiate and surround a nucleus; mitochondria and Golgi bodies are absent, respiratory organelles are endosymbiotic bacteria. Pelomyxapalustris is 1 to 5 mm in diameter with hundreds of nuclei and several flagella; Mastigamoeba and Mastigel'la have one flagellum and one nucleus. In microoxic freshwater sediments. Some systematists regard caryoblasts as premitochondrial eukaryotes, and thus among the most primitive of living protists.	
025	HETEROLOBOSA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	AMEBAS	HETEROLOBOSA						Cells have an inducible flagellated stage with two to four functional flagella; lobopodia seem to erupt during ameboid movement. Encystment occurs under adverse conditions. Freshwater and marine sediments. Naegleria (two flagella; cause of primary amebic meningoencephalitis), Tetramitus (fourflagella). Contemporary systematists include this taxon with the flagellates.	
026	AMOEBOZOA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	AMEBAS	AMOEBOZOA						Polyphyletictaxon: cells with pseudopodia that lack MTs. MTs are associated only with the mitotic spindle; fla- gella and centrioles are absent; freshwater, marine, terrestrial, and symbiotic habitats. “Lobosea,” with lobopodia, includes the naked (atestate) amebas—Acanthamoeba, Amoeba, Chaos, Entamoeba, Vannella—and the testate amebas—Arcella, Difflu- gia. “Filosea,” with rapidly forming filopodia, includes testate and atestate species: Euglypha, Gromia, Vampyrella.	
027	FORAMINIFEREA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	FORAMINIFEREA							The large taxon Foraminiferea (forams or foraminifers) is primarily marine. The countless filiform pseudopodia, called reticulopodia, actively branch and interconnect (anastomose) to form a complex threadlike mesh, usually known as a reticulopodial network. Each reticulopodium has an axis of microtubules that shuttles vesicles bidirectionally to and from the cell body. The abundant vesicles confer a granular appearance on the reticulopods. Locomotion in creeping forams, such as AUogromia, results from extension of the reticulopodial network, anchorage on the substratum, and retraction of the net, which pulls the cell body forward. Movement of the reticulopodial net involves lengthening and shortening of the axial microtubules.	
028	ALLOGROMIINA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	FORAMINIFEREA	ALLOGROMIINA						Organic test is flexible and sometimes has attached foreign matter. India, Myxotheca, Nemogullmia.	
029	TEXTURALIINA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	FORAMINIFEREA	TEXTURALIINA						Organic test made rigid by adding foreign particles. Allogromia, Ammodiscus, Astrorhiza, Clavulina, Textularia.	
030	MILIOLINA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	FORAMINIFEREA	MILIOLINA						Calcareous test resembles porcelain. Amphisorus (mermaid’s penny), Pyrgo (ooze former), Quinqueloculina, Sorites.	
031	ROTALIINA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	FORAMINIFEREA	ROTALIINA						Calcareous test is glassy (hyaline) and has pores. Bulimina, Discorhis, Globigerinoides (planktonic), Homotrema, Lagena, Marginulina, Rotaliella.	
032	ACTINOPODA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	ACTINOPODA							The actinopods are primarily spherical, planktonic cells with long, stiff, needlelike pseudopodia called axopodia that radiate outward like spikes on a mace. The axis of each axopodium contains a supportive axial rod that is a bundle of microtubules originating in the cell body. Bidirectional shuttling of vesicles occurs in axopodia, as in reticulopodia, and they can shorten rapidly after contacting and adhering to prey. The axopods are used for prey capture, flotation, locomotion, and attachment to surfaces.	
033	RADIOLARIA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	RADIOLARIA							With a siliceous test that looks like a crystal starburst, radiolarians are among the most elegant protozoans. Entirely marine and primarily planktonic, radiolarians are relatively large protozoa: A few solitary species are millimetres in diameter, and some colonial species attain a length of up to 20 cm (Collozoum). The radiolarian cell is usually spherical and divided distinctly into medulla and cortex by a perforated organic test. Highly specialized perforations (fusules) in the test allow for the passage of the axopodia as well as vacuolated filopodia and reticulopodia that form the cortex. The cortex, sometimes highly vacoluated, functions in flotation, prey capture, and intracelular digestion as well as often bearing symbiotic dinoflagellates (zooxanthellae) or other photosynthetic protists. The medulla, which is often vacuolated peripherally, contains one to many nuclei and nutritional reserves, such as lipid drops (also used for buoyancy).	
034	POLYCYSTINEA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	RADIOLARIA		POLYCYSTINEA					Taxon contains the majority of familiar radiolarians. All have perforated siliceous skeletons and are solitary and colonial species, 30pm to 2mm in size. Collozoum, Eucoronis, Thallasicola.	
035	PHAEODAREA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	RADIOLARIA		PHAEODAREA					Taxon of deep-sea radiolarians having a siliceous test with hollow spines and incorporated organic matter. Central capsule has three openings, one oral and two for axopods. Yellow-brown pigment mass (phaeodium) near the oral opening. Astracantha, Coelodendrum, Phaeodina.	
036	ACANTHAREA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	ACANTHAREA							Acanthareans are planktonic marine actinopods that superficially resemble radiolarians. The cell is a radially symmetric sphere from which project slender axopodia and 10 to 20 stout skeletal spines. The intracellular spines unite in the center of the medulla, radiate outward, and project beyond the periphery of the cell. Myonemes attach to the spine bases and, on contraction, expand the cortex to the tips of the spines. Acantharean spines are composed of strontium sulfate and not the silica of radiolarians. Strontium sulfate is soluble in seawater and, after cell death, the skeleton soon dis- solves and leaves no trace either as a bottom ooze or in the fossil record. The cell is divided by a perforated organic test into a medulla and vacuolated cortex. The cortex is overlaid with a flexible extracellular cuticle. The medulla contains several nuclei and, often, zooxanthellae.	
037	HELIOZOA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	HELIOZOA							The spherical actinopods called heliozoans (sun animalcules) occur in the sea, in still bodies of fresh water, and in mosses. In aquatic habitats, they may be floating or, more commonly, located in bottom debris. Some benthic species are stalked.Numerous slender axopodia radiate stiffly from the surface of the cell, but can shorten or even “melt” as the axial microtubules depolymerize. Some heliozoan species have long, delicate filopodia in addition to the axopodia	
038	DESMOTHORACIDA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	HELIOZOA		DESMOTHORACIDA					Sessile, mostly stalked species; irregularly arranged axopod MTs; filopodia are present. Clathrulina, Hedriocystis, Orbulinellci.	
039	CILIOPHYIDA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	HELIOZOA		CILIOPHYIDA					Similar in form to actinophiyids, but adult bears a single flagellum with pinnate mastigonemes; axopods with few MTs. Actinomonas, Ciliophrys, Pteridomonas.	
040	TAXOPODIDA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	HELIOZOA		TAXOPODIDA					Bilaterally symmetric with stout siliceous spines in rosettes; axopodal MTs in a hexagonal pattern; marine. Sticholonche.	
041	CENTROHELIDA	PROTOZOA	AMEBOID PROTOZOA	HELIOZOA		CENTROHELIDA					Numerous slender and long axopods arise from a central point (centroplast); axopods bear extru- somes used in prey capture; often have surface covering of extracellular siliceous scales or spinelets; axopod MTs in hexagonal or triangular arrays. Acanthocystis, Gymnosphaera, Hedraiophrys, Heterophrys.	
042	SYMPLASMA	PORIFERA	SYMPLASMA								Glass sponges; have syncytial tissues; spicules are siliceous triaxonal hexactines that form intracellularly (sclerocytes are cellular, not syncytial). Many species have elongate bundle (“root”) of monaxons that anchor the sponge in mud bottoms; trichimella larva resembles modified parenchymella. Marine; approximately 400 extant species. EuplecteUa, Dactylocalyx, Hyalonema, Monoraphis, Rhabdocalyptus.

Megascleres: monaxons, triaxons, tetraxons; all spicules secreted intracellularly; mesohyl well developed; choanocytes typically smaller than pinacocytes and archeocytes. Marine and fresh water. (Currently, there is lack of consensus over the classification of subtaxa of Demospongiae).

Spicule types not localized in body; siliceous spicules are di-, tri-, and tetractines; spongin mostly absent. Larviparous with coeloblastula larva. Octavella and Oscarella have only mesohylar skeleton, lack spongin and spicules. Plakina (syconoid).	
046	TETRACTIONOMORPHA	PORIFERA	CELLULARIA	DEMOSPONGIAE	TETRACTIONOMORPHA						Demospongiae with tetraxons, aster- ose microscleres, and mostly without spongin. Oviparous.

CalcineasC: Calcarea with a choanocytic flagellum not in close association with the nucleus; nucleus in base of cell; triaxons have equiangular rays of equal length. Coeloblastula larva. Clathrina (asconoid) forms tubular network; Murray well developed and several taxa (“keratosa”) have spongin only; spicule types localized to specific tissues or regions.	
048	CALCAREA	PORIFERA	CELLULARIA	CALCAREA							Cellularia including species of asconoid, syconoid, and leu- conoid design; spicules are calcite, mostly unfused triaxons, tetraxons and monaxons; each spicule formed extracellularly by more than one sclerocyte. Mesohyl is thin; choanocytes relatively large, same size as pinacocytes and archeocytes. Larva a hollow blastula. Marine; 500 extant species.	
049	CALCINEA	PORIFERA	CELLULARIA	CALCAREA	CALCINEA						Calcarea with a choanocytic flagellum not in close association with the nucleus; nucleus in base of cell; triaxons have equiangular rays of equal length. Coeloblastula larva. Clathrina (asconoid) forms tubular network; Murrayona has a reticulate rigid skeleton of fused calcareous bodies (sclerodermites).

051	ANTHOZOA	CNIDARIA	ANTHOZOA								Anthozoa, or “flower animals,” includes the exclusively marine sea anemones, corals, sea fans, sea pens, and sea pansies. In their stunningly wide range of forms and colors, anthozoans create and accent coral-reef seascapes and tide pools with splashes of emerald, ruby, and amethyst. Anthozoa is the largest cnidarian taxon, containing over 6000 solitary and colonial species. Anthozoans are polyps only, and a medusa stage is absent. Thus the polyp is responsible for both sexual and, when present, asexual reproduction. As compared with the polyps of other cnidarian classes, anthozoans are large polyps that range in diameter from approximately 0.5cm to 1 m. Anthozoan body volume is variable because most have inflatable and retractile polyps. Anthozoan mesoglea contains amebocytes and is thus a true connective tissue. Anthozoa is the only cnidarian taxon that has all three types of cnidae — nematocysts, spirocysts, and ptychocysts.	
052	ZOANTHARIA	CNIDARIA	ANTHOZOA	ZOANTHARIA							Zoantharia includes approximately 4000 species of sea anemones, stony corals, coral anemones, mat anemones, and black or thorny corals. Zoantharian symmetry usually is hexamerous, with the septa occurring in multiples of six. Septa, which maybe complete or incomplete, typically are not single, but instead are closely set doubles called pairs. Only Antipatharia (black corals) and Ceriantharia (tube anemones) have single septa. A juvenile polyp usually has six pairs of septa and 12 tentacles, 1 tentacle extending from each interseptal space. As the polyp increases in size, a second round of six paired septa may be added along with an additional 12 tentacles. Two types of cnidaea represent, nemato cysts (six types) and spirocysts, the latter being unique to Zoantharia. The gonads form a longitudinal band behind the septal filament of each fertile septum. Zoantharians are represented by colonial and solitary species.	
053	ACTINARIA	CNIDARIA	ANTHOZOA	ZOANTHARIA		ACTINARIA					Sea anemones are generally large, solitary polyps. Most range from 1.5 to 10 cm in length and from 1 to 5 cm in diameter, but Tealia columbiana on the North Pacific coast of the United States and Stichodactyla mertensii and Heteractis magnified on the Great Barrier Reef of Australia may exceed a diameter of 1 m at the oral end. The height record of 1 m is held by Metridium farcimen of the Pacific Northwest coast of the United States. Sea anemones are often brightly colored white, green, blue, orange, red, or an entire palette of colors.	
053	SCELERACTINA	CNIDARIA	ANTHOZOA	ZOANTHARIA		SCELERACTINA					Closely related to sea anemones (Actiniaria) are the stony, or scleractinian, corals (also called madreporarian corals), which constitute the largest taxon of anthozoans with approximately 3600 species. In contrast to anemones, stony corals produce a calcium carbonate exoskeleton. Some corals, such as the Indo-Pacific reef-inhabiting Fungia and some deep-sea species, are solitary and have polyps as large as 50 cm in diameter, but the majority are colonial, with small polyps averaging 1 to 3 mm in diameter.	
054	ZOANTHIDEA	CNIDARIA	ANTHOZOA	ZOANTHARIA		ZOANTHIDEA					200 largely tropical and common reef- inhabiting species; do not secrete calcium carbonate, rely instead on periderm, hydrostat, mesoglea, sometimes embedded foreign matter for skeletal support, protection.

057	CERIANTHARIA	CNIDARIA	ANTHOZOA	ZOANTHARIA		CERIANTHARIA					All septa complete, unpaired, lack retractor muscles, thus cerianthids cannot invaginate oral disc and tentacles into the column for protection; single siphonoglyph and corresponding hyposulculus. Cerianthus, Ceriantheopsis, Pachycerianthus.	
058	ALCYONARIA	CNIDARIA	ANTHOZOA	ALCYONARIA							The exclusively marine and mostly colonial Alcyonaria (or Octocorallia) includes the colorful sea plumes, fans, pens and pansies, as well as organ-pipe coral, precious red coral, blue coral, and soft corals. Of the 2000+ species, most are associated with the coral reef community, but alcyonarians also are commonly encountered in shallow-water areas of the oceans worldwide and even in the deep sea.

066	MEDUSOZOA	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA								Cnidarians with a medusa stage in their life cycle constitute the taxon of Medusozoa. The basic life cycle, beginning with the adult, is: medusa—> planula—»polyp—» medusa. Medusozoans have tetramerous symmetry, based on four or multiples of four, and a linear mitochondrial DNA molecule, rather than the circular form found in Anthozoa and all other animals. Cnidae are present as nematocysts only; spirocysts and ptychocysts are absent. Medusozoa includes two major taxa, Scyphozoa (large jellies) and Flydrozoa (small jellies, Hydra, hydroids, and relatives). We begin with the large, conspicuous scyphozoans.	
067	SCYPHOZOA	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	SCYPHOZOA							The exclusively marine Scyphozoa includes the box jellies, stalked jellies, flag-mouth jellies, and root-mouth jellies. The taxon, which consists of only 200 species, is best known for its large medusae, which are seen washed ashore on beaches, adrift in nearshore currents, or pulsating rhythmically near the water’s surface. Because the medusae are conspicuous and common, references to “jellyfish” most often apply to these animals.	
068	SEMAEOSTOMEAE	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	SCYPHOZOA		SEMAEOSTOMEAE					The flag-mouth jellies are large medusae 10-30 cm in diameter (but can be up to 2m wide),in which the manubrium is elongate and divided into four oral arms.

072	STAUROMEDUSAE	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	SCYPHOZOA		STAUROMEDUSAE					25 species; sessile, attached, resemble sundew plants; often called “stalked jellies” because medusoid body attaches to sub-stratum by an aboral stalk; anatomy and development indicate adult is an overgrown polyp whose oral end is partially differentiated into a medusa.	
073	HYDROZOA	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	HYDROZOA							With some 3000 species, the diverse Hydrozoa is made up of chiefly colonial medusozoans in which the life cycle may include polyps, medusae, or both. Hydrozoans are the only cnidarians to form colonies combining both polyp-zooids and medusa-zooids. Colonial species include the sea weed like hydroids, the pelagic Portuguese man-of-war, and reef-building fire and rose corals.	
074	ANTHOATHECATAE	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	HYDROZOA		A-FORMS		ANTHOATHECATAE			Mostly colonial A-form hydroids; divided into two groups: Capitata and Filifera, based on structure of tentacles.

077	SIPHONOPHORA	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	HYDROZOA		A-FORMS		SIPHONOPHORA			Depending on their form, the pelagic siphonophores, with their trailing clusters of transparent zooids, resemble strings of diamonds or crystal chandeliers cruising through inners space.	
078	CYSTONECTIDA	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	HYDROZOA		A-FORMS		CYSTONECTIDA			Medusa zooids absent, except for gonophores and perhaps “jelly polyps” of Physalia, which may be modified nectophores.	
079	PHYSONECTIDA	CNIDARIA	MEDUSOZOA	HYDROZOA		A-FORMS		PHYSONECTIDA			Physonects, such as Nanomia bijuga and Physophora hydrostatica, often have long stems (up to 3 m in Apolemiauvaria), a pneumatophore, and nectophores.

089	LOBATA	CTENOPHORA	LOBATA								Common planktonic comb jellies; two expanded muscular oral lobes flank mouth and tentacles, creating a “subumbrellar” cavity; from base of each reduced tentacle, two auricular grooves, bearing tentilla, extend over subumbrellar surface of each lobe.	
090	GANESHIDA	CTENOPHORA	GANESHIDA								Two known species of Ganescha: found in tropical seas, superficially resemble lobate juveniles. Mouth flanked by two small oral lobes, a pair of tentacles present, but body is more or less circular in cross section and not appreciably compressed.	
091	CESTIDA	CTENOPHORA	CESTIDA								Remarkable, tropical-subtropical, planktonic ctenophores with body a transparent colorless ribbon or cummerbund. Tentacular axis short and pharyngeal axis extremely long. Four subtentacular comb rows rudimentary; remaining four along aboral edge of ribbon.

093	BEROIDA	CTENOPHORA	BEROIDA								Melon or miter jellies, up to 30 cm in length, all species of Bero'e and Neis. Lacking tentacles, often slighdy compressed, saclike body resembles a ski cap.	https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q5aOuKqiiu66Vm52hsa8f7R5TyO-nK1v/view?usp=sharing
094	TURBELLARIA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA								For many, the first contact with free-living flatworms is with planarians, those small, brownish, cross-eyed worms that live in freshwater streams under rocks. The lucky few who have explored a rocky seashore or a coral reef may have seen large, tissue-thin, stunningly colored marine flatworms that glide and shuffle over the substratum, conforming their bodies to every surface irregularity. Some fortunate others may have watched a sandy beach turn green as zoochlorellae-bearing turbellarians surfaced with the receding tide to expose themselves to the rays of the sun. These are the large, visible Turbellaria, or macroturbellaria, in the centimeter-size range.	
094	CATENULIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		CATENULIDA						Small body usually long and slender. Density of epidermal cilia low (two percell) as compared with remaining turbellarians. Head commonly has a statocyst (Catenula) with one statolith (uniquely behind brain), two ciliated pits, and often two colorless eyes.

103	TREPAXONEMATA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		TREPAXONEMATA						Sister taxon of Macrostomida plus Haplopharyngida (Macrostomorpha). With biflagellate sperm, the flagella of each with 9 + 1 axoneme.	
104	POLYCLADIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		POLYCLADIDA						Large (centimeter-size range; largest 30 cm), marine. More or less oval body highly flattened, tissue thin. Primarily benthic, but many species swim by undulating body margins.	
105	NEOOPHORA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		NEOOPHORA						Sister taxon of Polycladida. Flatworms (including parasitic platyhelminths) with heterocellular ovary. Ovary divided into two regions, egg-producing germarium (ovary) and yolk-cell- (vitellocyte-) producing vitellarium; ectolecithal “eggs” with some egg-capsule components contributed by glands associated with egg-laying duct.	
106	LECITHOEPITHELIATA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		LECITHOEPITHELIATA						Each egg surrounded by an epithelium-like monolayer of yolk cells. Germarium and vitellarium combined in a mixed germovitellarium. Mouth and complex pharynx are at anterior end of body; the gut is simple, unbranched.

110	TRICLADIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		TRICLADIDA						Large; tubular gut branches into three parts—one anterior, two posterior. Each of three branches has ceca. Three main gut branches unite in mid body, anterior to mouth and pharynx, to form common chamber where pharynx and mouth are located.	
111	RHABDOCOELA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		RHABDOCOELA						Small; bulbous pharynx, simple gut, one pair of nerve cords. Marine and fresh water. Includes remaining taxa.	
112	TYPHLOPLANOIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		TYPHLOPLANOIDA						Mouth and bulbous pharynx near middle of body; pharyngeal axis dorsoventral, pharynx (dorsal view) resembles a doughnut. Kalyptorhynchia: mostly marine, interstitial species with anterior terminal proboscis.	
113	DALYELLIOIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		DALYELLIOIDA						Marine and fresh water, some free-living (Dalyellia, Provortex), others commensal or parasitic on and in snails, clams, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.	
114	TEMNOCEPHALIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		TEMNOCEPHALIDA						Posterior ventral surface differentiated into adhesive disc, anterior margin bears fingerlike projections by which worm creeps leech like on its host.	
115	NEODERMATA	PLATYHELMINTHES	TURBELLARIA		NEODERMATA						Parasitic flukes and tapeworms.	
116	NEODERMATA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA								Few experiences are more memorable than firsthand encounters with parasitic flatworms, such as pulsating tapeworm proglottids emerging from a cat’s anus or a large fluke in the liver of a deer. The worms elicit feelings of revulsion but engage our morbid curiosity, and deserve admiration for their adaptive success. These parasites, which include flukes, tapeworms, and their relatives, are biologically remarkable animals. Most are endoparasites and many colonize a succession of different hosts in different environments before they complete their life cycle. Not only must they adjust physiologically to life in each of these abiotic and host environments, but also locate and infect each new host. Their fascinating biology is related to how they meet these challenges. From the standpoint of human ecology, these worms attack and debilitate economically important wild life and domestic animals, and humans themselves. Schistosomiasis, a fluke affliction of 300 million humans, is the third most common parasitic disease of humans, behind malaria and hookworm infections.	
117	TREMATODA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA		TREMATODA						Trematoda includes two subtaxa of closely related parasitic flatworms, Digenea, a large, economically and medically important taxon, and Aspidogastrea, a small taxon of no medical or economic importance.	
118	DIGENIA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA		TREMATODA	DIGENIA					Digeneans, known as flukes, are common endoparasites of all major vertebrate taxa: fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Some flukes cause debilitating disease in livestock and humans. With some 11,000 species, more than all other flatworms combined, digeneans are second in diversity only to the roundworms (Nematoda) among metazoan parasites.	
119	ASPIDOGASTREA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA		TREMATODA	ASPIDOGASTREA					Aspidogastrea (or Aspidobothrea) is a small trematodetaxon with similarities to other parasitic flatworms, but more closely related to Digenea. The distinguishing trait is a huge adhesive organ, which is either a single, septate sucker covering the entire ventral surface or a longitudinal row of suckers.	
120	CERCOMEROMORPHA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA		CERCOMEROMORPHA						The sister taxon of Trematoda, these important parasitic flatworms have crescent-shaped hooks on a posterior appendage, the cercomer, of their ciliated oncosphere or oncomiracidium larvae.	
121	MONOGENEA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA		CERCOMEROMORPHA	MONOGENEA					The approximately 1100 species of monogeneans are chiefly host-specific ectoparasites, or occasionally endoparasites, of aquatic vertebrates, especially fishes, but amphibians and reptiles are also hosts. Because most attach to the skin of a fast-moving host, monogeneans are dorsoventrally flattened and have a large, posterior attachment organ, the haptor, that bears hooks and suckers, allowing the parasite to cling tenaciously to the host.	
122	CESTODA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA		CERCOMEROMORPHA	CESTODA					Cestoda is the most evolutionarily derived of the flatworm taxa, and all 3400 species are endoparasites of the gut of vertebrates. A gut is absent and the neodermis is highly specialized for nutrient uptake from the host. Most species of Cestoda occur in Eucestoda, which is described here.	
123	MESOZOA	PLATYHELMINTHES	MESOZOA								Mesozoans are small, parasitic marine worms of simple anatomy that inhabit the nephridia of octopuses and cuttlefishes (Dicyemida) as well as the tissues and body cavities of other invertebrates (Orthonectida). The cylindrical body is more or less radially symmetric, except during some bilateral developmental stages. The compact body lacks gut, coelom, hemal system, nephridia, and neurons, and most species also lack muscle. The body wall consists solely of a monolayered, multiciliated epidermis around a core of one to several cells, including stem cells. The epidermis functions in locomotion and host nutrient uptake whereas the interior cells are reproductive. Mesozoan life cycles are complex, diverse, and, in most cases, not fully documented.	
124	ORTHONECTIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	MESOZOA		ORTHONECTIDA						The 20-some species of orthonectids are endoparasites of turbellarians, nemerteans, polychaetes, gastropod and bivalve molluscs, brittle stars, and tunicates. The tiny adults, less than 1mm in length bear a series of epidermal ciliary rings that encircle the body. These rings alternate with rings of nonciliated cells in a species-specific fashion. The ciliary rootlets of adjacent cilia are interjoined in an intracellular network. A thin cuticle covers the body. Below the cuticle and epidermis are an extra cellular matrix and myocytes containing very thick, longitudinally oriented filaments composed of the protein paramyosin. Internal to the muscle sheath is a mass of gametes, either sperm or eggs.	
125	DICYEMIDA	PLATYHELMINTHES	MESOZOA		DICYEMIDA						The 75 species of dicyemids are delicate, slender worms that parasitise the kidneys of octopuses and cuttlefishes, but usually not squids. They occur, typically in high densities, in the renal sac and pericardial cavity, both of which are urine-containing compartments. One end of the parasite attaches to the nephridium’s absorptive lining while the body endocytoses low-molecular-weight nutrients from the primary urine. It thus competes with the reabsorptive epithelium of the nephridium (and host).	
126	ANOPLA	NEMERTEA	ANOPLA								Simple, unarmed proboscis without stylet, mouth posterior to brain (both plesiomorphies, thus Anopla is paraphyletic).	
127	PALAEONEMERTEA	NEMERTEA	PALAEONEMERTEA								100 marine species. Body-wall musculature arranged in outer circular, inner longitudinal layers.	
128	HETERONEMERTEA	NEMERTEA	HETERONEMERTEA								Approximately 400 common and familiar species; majority are marine, but 3 species in fresh water. Four layers of body-wall muscles: an outer, weakly developed circular layer; a powerful longitudinal layer; another circular layer; and an innermost longitudinal layer. Nerve cords in the innermost circular muscle layer.	
129	ENOPLA	NEMERTEA	ENOPLA								Armed nemerteans (except Bdellonemertea); mouth anterior to brain. Nerve cords located inside body-wall musculature.	
130	BDELLONEMERTEA	NEMERTEA	BDELLONEMERTEA								Seven species of Malacobdella, six commensals in mantle cavity of large marine clams, including Macoma, Mercenaria, Mya, and Siliqua, one in mantle cavity of freshwater snail. Steal food from filter-feeding host. Short, wide, flat, leechlike.	
131	HOPLONEMERTEA	NEMERTEA	HOPLONEMERTEA								Most diverse nemertean taxon, 650 benthic, pelagic, commensal, parasitic marine species as well as fresh water and terrestrial species. Proboscis armed with stylet.	
132	MONOSTILIFERA	NEMERTEA	MONOSTILIFERA								500 benthic species. Proboscis with stylet bulb and single central stylet. Emplectonema, Nemertopsis: nearshore marine; individuals aggregate, intertwine threadlike bodies in a Gordian knot that only they can untie.	
133	POLYSTILIFERA	NEMERTEA	POLYSTILIFERA								About 100 pelagic and 50 benthic marine species. Instead of stylet bulb and stylet, have padlike structure that bears many thorny stylets. Nectonemertes: pelagic, gelatinous, buoyant, at depths of 650-1700 m.	
134	APLACOPHORA	MOLLUSCA	APLACOPHORA								Aplacophora consists of two taxa, Neomeniomorpha, and Chaetodermomorpha, of about 300 species of small, strange, wormlike marine molluscs. Aplacophorans are usually less than 5 mm in length, but some reach 30 cm. They differ from all other molluscs in the presence of calcareous spicules instead of a shell, in the absence or reduction of the foot, and in the cylindrical, wormlike shape of the body.	
135	NEOMENIOMORPHA	MOLLUSCA	APLACOPHORA		NEOMENIOMORPHA						The larger taxon. Reduced foot consists of mid ventral ridge in a longitudinal groove. Pedal pit present at anterior end of foot. Gills lost. Creep over hydroids and alcyonarian corals or across the sea bottom by using their narrow foot. Carnivores feed on the cnidarians on which they live.	
136	CHAETODERMOMORPHA	MOLLUSCA	APLACOPHORA		CHAETODERMOMORPHA						Small taxon of three families. Foot completely lost. A pair of gills in the posterior mantle cavity. Oral shield partly or completely encircles the mouth. Selective deposit feeders or carnivores burrowing in soft substrates.	
137	POLYPLACOPHORA	MOLLUSCA	POLYPLACOPHORA								Members of Polyplacophora are chitons, or coat-of-mail molluscs found only in the sea. Although some features of their structure and development are primitive, chitons are highly adapted for a life adhering to rocks and shells. Many live in shallow coastal waters, where they cling tenaciously in powerful surf and surge. About half of modern species live in the intertidal or shallow subtidal zones. Other species are found in deeper, quieter water. The elongate, oval body is strongly depressed dorsoventrally. Chitons are distinctive in having a shell composed of eight overlapping plates, which permits flexibility in conforming to the shape of the irregular, rocky substratum. Chitons lack cephalic eyes or tentacles and the head is poorly developed and indistinct. The mantle is thick and the foot is broad and flat to facilitate adhesion to hard substrates.	
138	PALEOLORICATA	MOLLUSCA	POLYPLACOPHORA		PALEOLORICATA						Extinct. Shell plates lack articulamentum.	
139	NEOLORICATA	MOLLUSCA	POLYPLACOPHORA		NEOLORICATA						All living chitons. Shell plates with articulamentum.	
140	LEPIDOPLEURINA	MOLLUSCA	POLYPLACOPHORA		LEPIDOPLEURINA						Small, mostly deepwater chitons less than 50 mm in length. Articulamenta lack or have poorly developed insertion plates. Gills relatively few in number and confined to the posterior ends of the pallial grooves.	
141	ISCHNOCHITONINA	MOLLUSCA	POLYPLACOPHORA		ISCHNOCHITONINA						Most chitons belong to this taxon. Much of the shell plate (tegmentum) is exposed.	
142	ACANTHOCHITONINA	MOLLUSCA	POLYPLACOPHORA		ACANTHOCHITONINA						Toothed insertion plates. Relatively small part, sometimes none, of tegmentum is exposed. Last (eighth) plate has large insertion plates.	
143	MONOPLACOPHORA	MOLLUSCA	MONOPLACOPHORA								Monoplacophorans resemble the generalized mollusc and are small, flattened, marine molluscs that inhabit deep water. Living representatives are 3 mm to little more than 3 cm long and are bilaterally symmetrical. They were known from Cambrian to Devonian fossils but were thought to be extinct until 1952, when 10 living specimens of Neopilina galatheae were dredged from a deep ocean trench off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Since this discovery, specimens belonging to about 20 species and three genera have been collected from waters 1800 to 7000 m deep in the northern and southern Atlantic, Indian, and eastern Pacific Oceans. The only known shallow-water species was found off the California coast at about 200 m. The modern species are thought to be the remnants of a formerly large and abundant taxon of molluscs.	
144	GASTROPODA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA								Gastropoda is the largest and most diverse molluscan class. The gastropods are the snails and slugs, and the taxon includes an enormous diversity of these animals. The gastropod fossil record begins in the early Cambrian period and extends unbroken to the present. No other molluscan class has experienced the extraordinary adaptive radiation seen in the gastropods during this period. Gastropods originated in the sea, but have colonized fresh water and are the only mol- luscs found in terrestrial habitats. Among metazoan animals, only the vertebrates, crustaceans, and perhaps the annelids have enjoyed similar success in all three major environments. Estimates of the number of species vary widely from 40,000 to 100,000 species, but there are probably around 60,000 described, extant gastropods and another 15,000 known fossil species. Gastropods are primarily benthic and have become adapted to life on all types of bottoms, but some are adapted to a pelagic life. The pulmonate snails and slugs, as well as several other groups, have conquered land by eliminating the gills and converting the mantle cavity into a lung. Three major groups, the prosobranchs, pulmonates, and opisthobranchs, have tended to specialize along different lines. The prosobranchs are primarily benthic marine animals, whereas pulmonates have capitalized on the ecological possibilities of aerial respiration and opisthobranchs have experimented with the advantages of losing the shell.	
145	PATELLOGASTROPODA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		PATELLOGASTROPODA						Also called Docoglossa. The largest assemblage of limpets. Found from shallow water to the deep sea; many are common in the rocky intertidal areas. Evolved independently of keyhole limpets. Shell a noncoiled, symmetrical cone; symmetry may be primary.

148	CAENOGASTROPODA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		CAENOGASTROPODA						Includes the mesogastropods and neogastropods and thus most living prosobranchs. The great adaptive diversity of these two grades is in part due to the evolution of the monopectinate gill, which may have facilitated expansion from the ancestral rocky coasts into silty, especially soft-bottom, habitats. The dorsal and ventral membranes that suspend the archaeogastropod bipectinate gill are easily fouled by developed shell (Atlanta, Oxygyrus); Carinariidae has small sediment carried by the respiratory current.	
149	MESOGASTROPODS	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		MESOGASTROPODS						Snails with a single monopectinate gill, one atrium (monotocardian), one nephridium. Osphradium simple (ridgelike).

168	PYRAMIDEILOIDEA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		HETEROSTROPHA		PYRAMIDEILOIDEA				A large taxon of small carnivorous ectoparasites of bivalve molluscs and polychaetes	
169	OPISTHOBRANCHS	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		OPISTHOBRANCHS						The remaining two groups of gastropods, the opisthobranchs and pulmonates, are sometimes combined in Euthyneura, which is marked by the replacement of the twisted (streptoneurous) prosobranch nervous system with a secondarily bilaterally symmetrical (euthyneurous) system. In the euthyneuran nervous system, the effects of torsion are reversed by detorsion and the ganglia are highly concentrated and cephalized (moved close together in the head).	
170	CEPHALASPIDEA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		OPISTHOBRANCHS		CEPHALASPIDEA				Largest, most primitive taxon. The ancestors of most other opisthobranchs probably were cephalaspidean-like. In general, they are specialized for burrowing in soft sediments, and detorsion has moved the mantle cavity to the right or even the posterior end. The shell is usually reduced (as in Bulla), but primitive genera such as Acteon and Hydatina more closely resemble their prosobranch ancestors and have not yet become fully adapted to burrowing.

179	SACOGLOSSA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		OPISTHOBRANCHS		SACOGLOSSA				Herbivores that feed on cytoplasm sucked from macroalgae. Shell may or may not be present; a few (Juliidae: Berthelinia, Julia) have a bivalved, clamlike shell, but inside the two valves resides a typical snail. These are the only bivalved gastropods. Others are Elysiidae (Elysia, Tridachia), Stiligeridae (Alderia, Hermaea, Stiliger).	
180	ACOCHLIDIACEA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		OPISTHOBRANCHS		ACOCHLIDIACEA				Small, shell-less, gill-less, interstitial opisthobranchs that live in coarse sediments, sometimes in low salinities or fresh water. Includes Acochlidiidae (Acochlidium, Microhedyle).	
181	NOTASPIDEA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		OPISTHOBRANCHS		NOTASPIDEA				Diverse group of epifaunal carnivores, many of which feed on sponges or sea squirts. Shell may be present or absent, internal or external. Bilateral symmetry is superficial, a bipectinate gill is present, and the rhinophores have a longitudinal slit. Includes Umbraculidae (Umbraculum), Tylodinidae (Tylodina), Pleurobranchidae (Berthella, Berthellina, Pleurobranchus).	
182	PULMONATES	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		PULMONATES						The pulmonates contain the highly successful land snails, as well as many freshwater forms and a few intertidal marine species. Most freshwater snails and limpets and most terrestrial snails and slugs are pulmonates. Estimates of the number of described species vary widely from 16,000 to 30,000, but there is no doubting the success of this taxon. Pulmonates are not as diverse or heterogeneous as the prosobranchs, but they have prospered in habitats where competition from prosobranchs is reduced. They are widely distributed in both tropical and temperate regions throughout the world. The most primitive pulmonates are aquatic, both marine and freshwater, but the derived pulmonates are terrestrial and the grade has specialized in ecological niches open to air breathing gastropods. The aquatic species, being air breathers, are largely restricted to shallow water and the marine species are usually intertidal or supratidal.	
183	BASOMMATOPHORA	MOLLUSCA	GASTROPODA		PULMONATES		BASOMMATOPHORA				Have one pair of tentacles with an eye situated laterally at the base of each. Aquatic. Includes all marine and freshwater pulmonates.

Two pairs of tentacles, although the anterior, lower pair may be inconspicuous. The two eyes are located at the distal tips of the posterior, upper pair.	
185	CEPHALOPODA	MOLLUSCA	CEPHALOPODA								Cephalopoda is an ancient, highly specialized taxon of about 700 extant and 10,000 extinct species, including the chambered nautilus, cuttlefish, squids, and octopods as well as the fossil nautiloids, ammonoids, and belemnoids. Cephalopods are entirely carnivorous and most are swift, active, agile predators. They occupy ecological niches for fast pelagic carnivores similar to those occupied by fishes, with which they compete and share many convergent characteristics.	
186	NAUTILOIDEA	MOLLUSCA	CEPHALOPODA		NAUTILOIDEA						Small taxon with Nautilus being the only living genus. Soft anatomy of fossil nautiloids is unknown. The four living species have two pairs of gills (tetrabranchiate), two pairs of nephridia, an external (ectocochleate) straight or planispiral chambered shell, abundant arms, pinhole camera eye with no lens, no ink sac, no chromatophores.

199	VAMPYROMORPHA	MOLLUSCA	CEPHALOPODA		VAMPYROMORPHA						Characteristics are intermediate between squids and octopods and taxon has been classified with both. Represented in fossil record by several species, but only one, the deep-sea Vampyroteuthis infernalis, is alive today.

Bivalvia includes about 8000 described extant species, of which about 1300 live in fresh water and the remainder are marine. Bivalves range in size from the tiny freshwater fingernail clams, some of which are less than 2 mm in length, to the giant clam Tridacna of the South Pacific, which attains a length of over a meter and may weigh almost 300kg. The common name for bivalve is “clam,” and any bivalve is correctly called a clam, even if it is a scallop or oyster.	
204	BIVALVIA 	MOLLUSCA	BIVALVIA 		BIVALVIA 						Chiefly isomyarian deposit feeders with large labial palps and palpal tentacles.

218	SCAPHOPODA	MOLLUSCA	SCAPHOPODA								Scaphopoda contains about 500 described extant species of burrowing, exclusively marine molluscs popularly known as tusk, or tooth, molluscs because of their shape. They are the most recent molluscan higher taxon to appear in the fossil record and are highly derived. They probably are most closely related to the bivalves, although they bear little superficial resemblance to them. Scaphopods inhabit a tubular shell with an opening at each end and have a radula but lack gills. Like bivalves, they are bilaterally symmetrical and have a foot adapted for digging. Scaphopods live buried in sand, head downward and with the body steeply inclined. The small, posterior aperture usually projects slightly above the surface, but sometimes the animal may be completely buried to up to 30cm deep in the sediment. The majority of scaphopods are microcarnivores that burrow in sand at depths greater than 6m and up to 7000m. Although relatively common, they are not often encountered in shallow water, although at least one species occurs in the low intertidal. Empty shells often wash ashore on some coasts.

221	POLYCHAETA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA								Polychaetes, or bristleworms, are the diverse, common, and often colorful annelids of the sea. And diversity is the key word in describing the form, function, and lifestyles of polychaetes. Of the 8000 species, most are burrowers, but some crawl over the bottom or on the surfaces of attached organisms, others bore into shells of rocks, many can swim when necessary, and a few are permanently pelagic. Still others secrete and occupy tubes, such as the spectacular feather-duster worms whose colorful crowns grace seawater aquaria and a variety of natural habitats. Polychaetes generally are medium-size worms of less than 10 cm in length and 2 to 10 mm in diameter, but many interstitial forms are less than 1 mm, and some species (Eunice, Nereis, Polyodontes) are real giants that approach or exceed a length of 1m and a diameter as thick as your thumb. The largest known polychaete is Eunice aphroditois, whose body exceeds 3 m in length.	
222	SCOLECIDA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SCOLECIDA						Prostomial appendages are absent, but two or more pairs of cirri are on the pygidium. Most are burrowers or tube dwellers with a bulbous protrusible pharynx. Sediment is directly ingested with non muscular pharynx and mouth (direct deposit feeders). “Sedentary” polychaetes.	
223	ARENICOLIDEA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SCOLECIDA	ARENICOLIDAE					Lugworms are common direct deposit feeders. Arenicola (and Abarenicold) lives in an L-shaped burrow that opens to the surface on the long side. The head of the worm is situated at the blind end of the horizontal part of the burrow, where sand is continually ingested by means of a simple pharynx. The ingested sand is rich in surface organic material, which tumbles into the surface depression above the animal’s head and slumps downward to the worm. Cilia in the everted pharynx drive loose particles into the gut, and some particle sorting occurs.	
224	MALDANIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SCOLECIDA	MALDANIDAE					Bamboo worms, such as Clymenella and Axiothella, are deposit-feeding tube dwellers. Their sand-grain tubes, which resemble beverage straws, are common in the intertidal zone. Bamboo worms have wedge like heads; long, distinct segments and segment joints that have the appearance of bamboo cane and its joints; and parapodia reduced to low ridges. The worms live upside down in their tubes and ingest the substratum from below.	
225	CAPITELLIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SCOLECIDA	CAPITELLIDAE					Earthwormlike with reduced parapodia and no head appendages. Like earthworms, most feed on sediment as they burrow through it. Most capitellids are red because of abundant hemoglobin in the coelomic fluid. Pressurized coelomic fluid everts the thin-walled pharynx, which in living animals resembles a blood blister. Most capitellids are small, but one, the giant (80 cm) Notomastus lobatus (maitre d’worm), lives in clayey sediment along the southeastern coast of the United States. It occupies a permanent helical burrow that it shares with no fewer than eight species of commensals, including one scaleworm and two other polychaetes, three clams, acrab, and anamphipod. Capitella.	
226	ORBINIIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SCOLECIDA	ORBINIIDAE					Earthwormlike in form and habits. They are often red or orange, depending on species. The prostomium lacks appendages. Proceeding from anterior to posterior along the body, the parapodia shift from lateral to dorsal. The eversible pharynx resembles that of capitellids, but orbiniids such as Orbinia ornata and Scoloplos rubra have paired comblike gills, derived from dorsal cirri, that arch over their backs.	
227	OPHELIIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SCOLECIDA	OPHELIIDAE					Includes burrowers that ingest sediment with an eversible bulbous pharynx. They often have lateral gills, and sometimes lateral eyes. Some, such as Travisia, resemble short, fat, sluggish grubs. Ophelia and Armandia are fishlike, streamlined, and fast, being adapted to live in current-swept sand. They move like fish, too, swimming rapidly through either loose sand or water. Among other adaptations for swimming, their pygiclium is modified into a tail fin. They so closely resemble amphioxus (Chordata) that collectors often mistake the annelid for the chordate. Euzonus.	
228	PALPATA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA						Sister of taxon of Scolecida. Have a pair of sensory palps on the prostomium (sometimes translocated to the peristomium).	
229	PHYLLODOCIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	PHYLLODOCIDA					Aciculates having a tubular, muscular, eversible pharynx. The pharynx is in line, or coaxial, with the esophagus.	
230	TOMOPTERIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	TOMOPTERIDAE					Pelagic, transparent carnivores. Tomopteris is dorsoventrally flattened, lacks chaetae, and has very long cirri on segment.	
231	ALCIOPIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	ALCIOPIDAE					Pelagic, transparent carnivores. Vanadis and Rhynchonerella resemble paddleworms (Phyllodocidae), but have enormous, bulging eyes with which to locate prey.	
232	NEREIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	NEREIDAE					Ragworms such as Nereis (and other genera) actively crawl, burrow, and occasionally swim. Pharynx is muscular, eversible, and has a pair of stout jaws. Head has two antennae, two palps, four eyes, and four pairs of tentacular cirri. Some, such as Nereispelagicct, Nereis virens, and Nereis diversicolor, are omnivores that feed on algae, other invertebrates, and even detritus. Nereis succinea and Nereis longissima feed primarily on detritus in the sediments. Nereisfucata, a commensal with the hermit crab, is carnivorous. Nereis brandti, of the northwest coast of the United States, reaches 1.8 m in length and feeds primarily on green algae. Ceratonereis, Platynereis.	
233	GLYCERIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	GLYCERIDAE					Glycera (the bloodworm) and other genera occupy a subsurface gallery excavated in muddy bottoms. The gallery contains numerous loops that open to the surface. Lying in wait at the bottom of a loop, the worm uses its four tiny, vibration-sensitive antennae to detect surface movements of prey, such as small crustaceans. It then moves to the burrow opening and seizes the prey with its pharynx.	
234	NEPHTYIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	NEPHTYIDAE					Similar to bloodworms (Glyceridae). Have a long, eversible pharynx, but only two jaws instead of four; carnivores of worms and small crustaceans. Nephtys and other nephtyids are called shimmy worms for their rapid, almost vibratory lateral undulations of the body while swimming or burrowing in loose sand; sometimes called cat worms because the anterior prostomial margin bears two triangular palps that resemble a cat’s ears.	
235	APHRODITIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	APHRODITIDAE					Scaleworms, called such because of two rows of overlapping scales on the dorsal surface resembling fish scales. Each scale is a highly modified dorsal cirrus called an elytron (pi., elytra) that is borne on a short stalk. A few scaleworms burrow (sigalionids), others are secretive and occupy tight crevices beneath stones (polynoids), a few live in secreted tubes (polyodontids), but most are commensals (polynoids) in the burrows and tubes of other invertebrates or the shells of hermit crabs. Because most live in tight quarters, the scales may channel the ventilating water current between the scales and body wall. Elytra also bear a variety of sensory structures. In the scaleworm Aphrodite (the sea mouse), the entire dorsal surface, including the elytra, is covered with hairlike “felt” composed of long notopodial chaetae that trail back over the dorsal surface of the animal. Scale worms are considered to be carnivores, but little is known about the feeding habits of commensal species. Aphroditidae: Aphrodite, Laetmonice; Polynoidae: Arctonoe, Halosynda, Harmothoe, Lepidasthenia, Lepidonotus; Polyodontidae: Polyodontes; Sigalionidae: Sthenelais. May also include Thalanessa. 	
236	HESIONIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		PALPATA	HESIONIDAE					Active commensals or free living (Ophiodromus, Podarke) and a few tiny species in the interstitial habitat, the labyrinthine water-filled spaces between grains of sand. Of the latter, Hesionides crawls in typical polychaete fashion using parapodia, but interstitial polychaetes of Saccocirridae, Protodrilidae, Polygordiidae (Polygordius), and Diurodrilidae have lost the parapodia and rely on cilia for locomotion. Although previously classified as Archiannelida because of their simple body design (and small size), Diurodrilidae is now considered to be a member of Eunicida (discussed below), whereas the remaining families are tentatively placed within Canalipalpata (also discussed below).	
237	MYZOSTOMIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		MYZOSTOMIDA	MYZOSTOMIDAE					Commensals on sea lilies and feather stars or internal parasites of sea stars (Echinodermata). Myzostoma and relatives are little worms that rarely exceed 5 mm in length and superficially resemble flatworms, but when disturbed they scoot rapidly away on stubby legs, each one terminating in a hooked chaeta. Oval body is greatly flattened; five pairs of parapodia on the undersurfacc. Parapodia, chaetae, and segmented nervous system indicate that Myzostomida belongs to Polychaeta, but its sister taxon is unknown; placement in Aciculata is provisional.	
238	EUNICIDA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA						Aciculates with five antennae and usually well-developed parapodial gills. The retracted eversible pharynx is slung ventrally below the level of the esophagus.	
239	EUNICIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA	EUNICIDAE					Members have a muscular, eversible pharynx that bears two stout mandibles and other accessory teeth. Includes the longest polychaete, Eunice aphroditois, a 3-m-long carnivorore from the tropical Indo-Pacific. Palola, some species of which are known as palolo worms, are famous for epitokal swarming and their savory flavor. Marphysa burrows in fine muddy sands, and Lysidice, like Palola, occurs in coralline rock.	
240	AMPHINOMIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA	AMPHINOMIDAE					Mostly large, chiefly tropical, often beautifully colored, caterpillar-like fireworms are carnivores living on corals and driftwood, beneath stones, occasionally in sediment. Eat coral polyps, anemones, stalked barnacles, and other sessile invertebrates by prying them loose with a muscular lower lip and sucking them in whole. Goose barnacles (Lepas) ingested whole and later defecated as museum-quality barnacle shells. Fireworms are notorious for their defensive chaetae, which are uniquely calcified, brittle, and toxic. When bare skin brushes against the chaetae, they penetrate the skin, break free of the worm, and create a burning pain. Avoided by fish and experienced scuba divers. Amphinome, Chloeia, Eurythoe, Hermodice.	
241	ONUPHIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA	ONUPHIDAE					Tube-dwelling aciculates; tubes are protective retreats and the occupants crawl actively within them by using well-developed parapodia. Diopatra, Onuphis, and Americonuphis build tough, conspicuous, membranous tubes that project vertically above the surface of the sand. The tube’s chimney is crooked and flared like a ship’s ventilator funnel. The chimneys are covered with bits of shell, seaweed, and other debris that the worm collects and positions with its jaws. Such ornamentation provides camouflage, and some worms graze on the algae planted on their own as well as their neighbors’ chimneys.	
242	SYLLIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA	SYLLIDAE					The tiny, abundant, diverse syllids are the polychaete answer to mosquitoes. They pierce prey with a pharyngeal tooth and then suck out the contents with a specialized, muscular part of the pharynx, the proventriculus. Mostly in shallow water and common on coral reefs, in fouling communities. Typical prey are hydroids, sponges, bryozoans, and other sessile invertebrates. Autolytus, Odontosyllis, Myrianida, Plakosyllis, Proceraea, Syllis, Typosyllis, Trypanosyllis, and many others.	
243	DENONIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA	DENONIDAE					Includes Arabella tricolor (the opalworm) and Drilonereis (the threadworms). Slender, often threadlike burrowers; some are direct deposit feeders, others are carnivores with well- developed pharyngeal jaws. Cuticle usually is glossy and iridescent. Curiously, juveniles of several species are endoparasites in the coelomic cavities of other polychaetes and echiurans. Labrorostratus.	
244	LUMBRINERIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA	LUMBRINERIDAE					Slender burrowers with reduced head appendages, well-developed pharynx and jaws. Carnivores. Lumbrineris.	
245	ICHTHYOTOMIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		EUNICIDA	ICHTHYOTOMIDAE					Ectoparasitic on eel fins. Ichthyotomus.	
246	SPIONIDA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SPIONIDA						Have palps on peristomium instead of prostomium, which is thought to have occurred by displacement of the original prostomialpalps.	
247	SPIONIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SPIONIDA	SPIONIDAE					Tube-dwelling palp worms are either surface deposit feeders or suspension feeders; some may be both. Two long peristomial palps project from the tube opening and extend over the bottom. Particles that ad here to the surface are transported to the mouth in a ciliated channel along the length of each palp. Tubes of Spio, Scolelepis, and Streblospio generally are soft, straight, and cylindrical and have incorporated sand or mud, but the suspension-feeding Polydora bores into calcareous substrates, including the shells of living oysters, in which they form unsightly shell “blisters.”	
248	MAGELONIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SPIONIDA	MAGELONIDAE					Shovel-headed borrowers that have a stiff, flat, spatulate prostomium that over hangs the mouth. The long peristomial palps are covered with short, sticky papillae that collect and pass deposited organic particles to the mouth. The threadlike worms are violet because of hemerythrin-containing hemocytes, unique among polychaetes. Magelonids such as Magelona are the only polychaetes with cross-striated muscles, the significance of which has yet to be determined.	
249	CHAETOPRIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SPIONIDA	CHAETOPRIDAE					Filter feeders that have straight (vertical) or U-shaped tubes partially buried in sand on protected beaches. Chaetopterus, Mesochaetopterus, Spiochaetopterus filter feed with one or more mucous nets suspended inside of the tube. As the water passes through, plankton are strained out and periodically the net and food are rolled up into a ball and swallowed.	
250	TEREBELLIDA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		TEREBELLIDA						Terebellidans have numerous peristomial feeding “tentacles” (palps).	
251	TEREBELLIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		TEREBELLIDA	TEREBELLIDAE					Spaghetti worms occupy tubes or simple vertical or U-shaped burrows in the sediment. Prostomial sensory appendages are absent, but clusters of highly extensible tentacles are borne on the head. Movement through the burrow usually is by peristaltic contractions. The parapodia are greatly reduced and are in part represented by transverse ridges provided with uncini, which grip the sides of the burrow. In terebellids such as Amphitrite, which occupies a U-shaped burrow, the hooks are oriented oppositely on the anterior and posterior ends of the animal. As a result, attempts to pull the worm from either the head or tail end of its burrow are opposed by the uncini. Other common genera include Lanice, Lysilla, Terebella, Thelepus.	
252	AMPHARETIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		TEREBELLIDA	AMPHARETIDAE					Ampharete and Melinna (spaghetti-mouth worms) are surface deposit feeders similar to terebellids that use extensible tentacles. Unlike terebellids, however, the tentacles originate from the roof of the mouth and can be withdrawn into it. Ampharetids occupy straight, vertical tubes, from which they emerge head first to feed on detritus.	
253	CIRRATILIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		TEREBELLIDA	CIRRATILIDAE					Fringed worms, such as Cirratulus and Cirriformia, are burrowers that deposit feed with a single pair, or two anterior clusters, of long feeding palps. A pair of long gill filaments, similar in appearance to the palps, occurs on each of many body segments. Dodecaceria.	
254	PECTINARIIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		TEREBELLIDA	PECTINARIIDAE					Amphictene, Cistenides, and Pectinaria (scaphopod like ice cream cone worms) construct a conical, one-layer-thick tube of cemented sand grains. The tube is open at its base and apex and the worm occupies it with its head at the broad basal end. Tube and worm are oriented head down in fine sand; the tube apex projects just above the sediment surface. Organics-rich sand is shoveled into the mouth with short, stout, golden chaetae (paleae), which together function as an operculum to close the tube aperture when the worm withdraws. Feces are released to the surface of the beach through the tube apex, which also provides an inlet for ventilating the gill surfaces.	
255	FLABELLIGERIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		TEREBELLIDA	FLABELLIGERIDAE					Burrowers with cephalic gills that can be retracted with the prostomium into the anterior segments. Extended gills and feeding palps are enclosed in a “cage” of long anterior chaetae. Cuticle has embedded sand grains. Hemocytes have chlorocruorin. Flabelligera, Piromis.	
256	SABELLIDA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SABELLIDA						Suspension feeders having a crown of tentacles in the form of a tiara, funnel, spiral, or bilobed fringe. Prostomium and peristomium are fused.	
257	OWENIIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SABELLIDA	OWENIIDAE					Owenia fusiformis (shingle-tube worm; builds a cylindrical tube of flat shell fragments incorporated into the organic tube fabric like overlapping roof tiles or shingles. The tube, head-end up, is oriented vertically in the beach and projects slightly above the sediment surface. The free edges of the shell shingles are oriented upward, making it difficult for a bird or current to dislodge the tube from the sand. The overlapping arrangement of the shell fragments also allows the tube to elongate, shorten, and bend as the worm within it moves. According to a nearly investigation, Owenia is able to burrow through sand while occupying its flexible tube. Owenia deposit and suspension feed with a crown of short, branched tentacles. Sediment particles are collected during feeding and those suitable for tube construction are stored in a ventral pouch below the mouth. During construction of the tube, the movable pouch fastens a fragment to the margin of the tube. The membranous tube lining is secreted by paired glands in each of the first seven trunk segments. The secretion is applied by parapodial chaetae as the worm revolves. Myriochele.	
258	SABELLARIIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SABELLIDA	SABELLARIIDAE					Sabellaria and Phragmatopoma (mason worms) build straight or curved cylindrical sand-grain tubes with walls more than one grain thick. The worms typically aggregate, sometimes by the millions, and cement their tubes together to form hard crusts or boulder-size mounds that resemble giant honeycombs. In warm-water areas such as the eastern coast of southern Florida and parts of England, these shallow-water structures form reefs that often are degraded by storms but quickly rebuilt. Anteriorly, two fused segments have grown forward and dorsally to form an operculum for blocking the tube entrance.	
259	SABELLIDAE	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		SABELLIDA	SABELLIDAE					Among the most beautiful of the sedentary polychaetes are the fan worms, feather duster worms, or Christmas-tree worms. These families have prostomial palps that form a funnel shaped or spiral crown of from a few to many bipinnate tentacles called radioles; the side branches of each are the pinnules. The radioles are rolled up or folded together as the worm withdraws into its protective tube. Sabellids build membranous or sand-grain tubes. Because serpulids and spirorbids secrete calcareous tubes attached to rocks, shells, or algae, they can live protected on more or less exposed substrata.	
260	POGONOPHORA	ANNELIDA	POLYCHAETA		POGONOPHORA						The 80-plus species of beard worms are remarkable deepwater polychaetes associated with continental slopes and hydrothermal vents. All are slender (some threadlike), sedentary worms that occupy chitin-protein tubes. The smallest is approximately 5 cm in length and Riftia pachyptila of the Galapagos Rift is the giant, measuring up to 1.5 m in length and almost 4 cm in diameter.	
261	CLITELLATA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA								The clitellate annelids, called girdle worms, include the earthworms, many small and inconspicuous worms, as well as leeches and their relatives. All clitellates lack parapodia and head and pygidial appendages. Clitellates have a clitellum, a series of anterior segments enclosed in a thick, glandular epidermis that often forms a conspicuous girdle around the body. The clitellum either encompasses the female gonopores or is located behind them. The clitellum secretes mucus for copulation, nutritious albumen for eggs, and a cocoon in which eggs and albumen are deposited. In contrast to the gonochoric spawning polychaetes, clitellates are copulating hermaphrodites. Clitellate gonads are always restricted to a few genital segments with the testes anterior to the ovaries. The zygotes develop in the cocoon and emerge as juveniles, so clitellates have direct development. Unlike the ancestral annelid and the polychaetes, the clitellate brain has shifted posteriorly from the prostomium to an anterior trunk segment.	
262	OLIGOCHAETA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		OLIGOCHAETA						The 3500-some species of oligochaetes include the earth-worms and many small freshwater and marine species. The small-bodied freshwater oligochaetes burrow in bottom mud and silt whereas others live among submerged vegetation. Of the 200 marine species, most are tiny animals that live between sand grains at depths from shallow intertidal beaches to the deep sea. The largest oligochaetes are the earthworms, including the up-to-3-m-long giant Australian earthworm, Megascolides australis.	
263	AEOLOSOMATIDAE	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		OLIGOCHAETA	AEOLOSOMATIDAE					Aeolosomci: small interstitial worms, usually less than 5 mm in length. Ventrally ciliated prostomium for gliding over and through substratum and for sweeping food particles into mouth. Chaetae on most segments, including anterior segments, but segmental septa are absent. One pair of testes and ovaries. Sexual reproduction is rare; clonal reproduction, by paratomy, is common. Encystment of adults occurs under adverse conditions. Although included here among oligochaetes, aeolosomatids may actually be polychaetes. The chief argument in favor of a polychaete alliance is the occurrence of nuchal organs on the prostomium (as “ciliated pits”), a polychaete autapomorphy. The brain of Aeolosoma is in the prostomium, as it is in polychaetes, not in an anterior segment. Aeolosoma also lacks a clitellum, the hallmark of clitellates.	
264	NAIDIDAE	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		OLIGOCHAETA	NAIDIDAE					Small, aquatic, predominantly freshwater oligohaetes similar to tubificids (below), but differing in living on submerged vegetation and having ocelli. Like the aeolosomatids, naidids have few segments, not more than 40. Prostomium lacks cilia, chaetae are absent from anterior segments, but segmental septa are present. Some have a long proboscis. As in aeolosomatids, there is one pair each of testes and ovaries; sexual reproduction has been infrequently observed. Paratomy is common: under ideal conditions, a new zooid is released every two or three days. Aulophorus: a pair of long gills on posterior end. Branchiura: a dorsal and a ventral gill filament on each posterior segment. Chaetogaster: a rudimentary prostomium, large mouth and large muscular pharynx for engulfing prey; carnivores of other worms, crustaceans, and insect larvae; parasites (in snails). Dero: makes sand-grain tubes and has small posterior gills. Stylaria: prostomium drawn out into a long process. Nais, Slavina.	
265	TUBIFICIDAE	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		OLIGOCHAETA	TUBIFICIDAE					Small to large, reddish burrowers in marine and freshwater sediments. The most common oligochaetes in deep freshwater sediments. Body composed of 40 to 200 distinctsegments, the number depending on species. Some, such as Tubifex, build and occupy vertical tubes from which they extend and wave their tails for gas exchange. Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus spp. thrive on organic pollution and tolerate low oxygen concentrations in the water. In highly polluted lakes and streams, tubificids are the only animals in the benthic sediments, where they form dense, waving beds. The marine Phallodrilus albidus lacks a gut and derives its nutrition in association with bacteria that oxidize reduced inorganic compounds. One pair of testes and one pair of ovaries; sexual reproduction is common, clonal reproduction is not.	
266	LUMBRICULIDAE	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		OLIGOCHAETA	LUMBRICULIDAE					Freshwater worms, small (not exceeding 14 cm in length), but having many segments, each with four pairs of chaetae. Clonal reproduction by fragmentation dominates. The educationally useful California blackworm, Lumbriculus variegatus, is the best-known lumbriculid. In the laboratory, this easily cultured species, with its transparent body wall and rapid rate of asexual reproduction, is used to study functional morphology, regeneration, segment differentiation, locomotion, and other behaviors.	
267	HIRUDINOMORPHA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA						This clitellate taxon includes the tiny branchiobdellids (Branchiobdellida), which cling and creep over the exoskeleton of freshwater crustaceans, especially crayfishes, and the often large, active, and intimidating leeches (Hirudinea). Leeches are common in fresh water, but also occur in the sea and in moist areas on land. All hirudinomorphs have a terminal or posterior sucker that adheres to the host or the substratum and a dorsal anus located in front of the sucker. The repositioning of the ancestral anus from terminal to dorsal is related to the origin of the sucker, which is a specialization of the posterior most segment (and often several others) as well as the pygidium. If the anus had not shifted position, it would open centrally below the sucker. Approximately 500 species of hirudino morphs have been described.	
268	BRANCHIOBDELLIDA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA	BRANCHIOBDELLIDA					The taxon includes 150 species of tiny (1 to 10 mm) ectocommensals or ectoparasites on the surfaces of crayfishes and fresh-water crabs. On crayfishes, some are ectoparasites on the gills, whereas others live on the exoskeletal surface and graze on organic debris and microorganisms. Often the crustacean’s head, carapace, and other parts are covered with these whitish worms. Chaetae, prostomium, and pygidium usually are absent. Body has 15 segments, the last forming a sucker. Head (peristomium plus three segments) is modified into a sucker with the mouth at its center. Buccalcavity contains two teeth, one dorsal and one ventral. Dorsal anus is on segment 14. Segmented coelom, more or less typical annelidan hemal system, two pairs of metanephridia. Hermaphrodites with internal fertilization. Zygotes deposited in cocoons attached to host. Embryos develop into crypcolarvae, as in arhychobdellid leeches. Branchiobdella.	
269	HIRUDINEA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA	HIRUDINEA					Sister taxon of Branchiobdellida. Includes typical leeches (Euhirudinea) with anterior and posterior suckers; also Acanthobdella peledina, a primitive leech with only a posterior sucker and several plesiomorphic traits not inherited by euhirudineans. All hirudineans have crossed-helical (diagonal) body wall muscles, sperm packaged in spermatophores, an unpaired female gonopore, and sperm storage that does not include seminal receptacles.	
270	EUHIRUDINEA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA	HIRUDINEA	EUHIRUDINEA				Sister taxon of Acanthobdella peledina. 350 species of “true” leeches with anterior and posterior suckers. Body composed of prostomium plus 33 segments; posterior sucker of 7 segments. Chaetae absent, segmental coeloms lack septa and mesenteries and have transformed into circulatory channels.	
271	RHYNCHOBDELLIDA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA	HIRUDINEA	RHYNCHOBDELLIDA				Aquatic leeches with a protrusible muscular pharynx, with coelomic and hemal circulatory systems. Feed by protruding pharynx, which seeks a favorable penetration site on the host’s surface, and then thrusts deeply into the body-wall tis- sues. Once inside, radial pharyngeal muscles contract and suck tissue and fluids into the leech’s gut. Some, such as Glossiphonia and Helobdella (Glossosiphoniidae), feed only on invertebrates, (snails, oligochaetes, crustaceans, insects), but vertebrates (amphibians, turtles, snakes, alligators, crocodiles) are hosts for most species. The cosmopolitan Theromyzon attaches to the nasal membranes of shore and waterbirds. Fish leeches (Piscicolidae) parasitize both freshwater and marine fish, including sharks, and rays. Their bodies often bear lateral gills. Glossosiphoniidae: Haementeria, Hemiclepsis, Placobdella, Theromyzon; Piscicolidae: Branchellion, Cystobranchus, Piscicola, Pontobdella, Ozobranchus, Trachelobdella.	
272	ARHYNCHOBDELLIDA	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA	HIRUDINEA	ARHYNCHOBDELLIDA				Hemal system absent, coelom constitutes sole circulatory system. Each segment typically has five annotations. Primarily aquatic, but some are amphibious or even terrestrial. Semiterrestrial Haemopsis terrestris occasionally plowed up in fields in the midwestern United States. Fully terrestrial status has been attained in the Haemadipsidae, whose species inhabit humid rain forests in south Asia and Australia. Haemadipsa, Phytobdella.	
273	GNATHOBDELLIFORMES	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA	HIRUDINEA	GNATHOBDELLIFORMES				Chiefly aquatic or amphibious blood-suckers. Nonprotrusible pharynx and three pairs of slicing jaws in buccal cavity; salivary glands secrete the anticoagulant hirudin and other compounds. The aquatic Hirudo medicinalis (European medicinal leech; Hirudinidae) is the best-known leech.	
274	PHARYNGOBDELLIFORMES	ANNELIDA	CLITELLATA		HIRUDINOMORPHA	HIRUDINEA	PHARYNGOBDELLIFORMES				Predatory, best known for the freshwater Erpobdella, with its long, nonprotrusible pharynx that occupies the anterior one-third of the body. Jaws are absent, but the muscular sucking pharynx, with its Y shaped lumen, enables these leeches to engulf large invertebrate prey. Dina.	
275	ECHIURIDAE	ECHIURA			ECHIURIDAE						Six species of Echiurus. Chaetae arranged in an anterior pair plus two rings around the posterior end of the trunk. Marine, in shallow temperate and tropical waters.	
276	URECHIDAE	ECHIURA			URECHIDAE						Four species of Urechis. All construct U-shaped burrows through which water is pumped for gas exchange and filter feeding. Rudimentary prostomium assists in retrieval and ingestion of food-laden mucous net. Hemal system is absent. Anal water inhalation by cloaca and posterior intestine specialized for gas exchange. Two or three pairs of metanephridia in anterior trunk coelom. Trunk has an anterior pair of chaetae and a single posterior chaetal ring.	
277	THALASSEMATIDAE	ECHIURA			THALASSEMATIDAE						Approximately 70 species of Thalassema, Lissomyema, Listriolobus, and Ochetosoma, and others; chiefly in warm water. Lack circle of anal chaetae, but have a pair of stout chaetal hooks on the anterior trunk. Ochetosoma has 4 or 5 segmental pairs of genital sacs and Ikedosoma pirotansis has up to 20, but most have 1 to 3 pairs. Thalassema hartmani: large spoon-worm on southeastern U.S. coast. Its burrow, like that of Urechis caupo, provides shelter and food for several commensals. Lissomyema mellita: southeastern U.S. coast, in tests of dead sand dollars and fissures in discarded mollusc shells; it enters the test when small and becomes too large to leave. Thalassema dendrorhynchus: prostomium has gill filaments; in brackish-water lake in India. Anelassorhynchus abyssalis: dredged off the California coast from a depth of 2000 m.	
278	BONELLIIDAE	ECHIURA			BONELLIIDAE						70 species of Bonelliidae in warm and cold waters, at all ocean depths, approximately 60% of species below 3000 m, some at abyssal depths. Bonellia and most other species of Bonelliidae: prostomium long, often forked; trunk bears a pair of anterior chaetae, anal chaetae are absent; one to three unpaired genital sacs. Most species green because of bonellin. All exhibit pronounced sexual dimorphism; tiny males parasitic on females.	
279	IKEDIDAE	ECHIURA			IKEDIDAE						Monotypic taxon. Ikea taenioides: large burrower, exceeding 1m. Prostomium very long, can be autotomized and later regenerated; body-wall muscle layers include outer longitudinal and inner circular layers, opposite that in all other echiurans; up to 400 genital sacs in clusters rather than segmental pairs, suggesting secondary duplication. Sea of Japan.	
280	SIPUNCULIDEA	SIPUNCULA			SIPUNCULIDEA						Tentacles encircle the mouth. Most burrow in marine sediments, but Phascolion strombus (hermit sipunculan) and similar species occupy discarded snail shells. In some species of Phascolion, but not P. strombus, the body is permanently coiled to fit the whorls of its shell. Sipunculus nudus: best-known sipunculan; wide- spread, large, robust; burrows actively in sand. Xenosiphon: external gills on trunk; Themiste: stalked, branched tentacles; shallow water.	
281	PHASCOLOSOMATIDEA	SIPUNCULA			PHASCOLOSOMATIDEA						Tentacles dorsal to mouth, in an arc around the nuchal organ. (Associated ring canal still encircles the mouth, but is in dented dorsally, and nuchal organ is in that indentation; tentacles borne only on indented part of ring canal and thus are dorsal to the mouth.) Introvert usually bears a series of cuticular rings, each composed of tiny cat’s-claw-shaped hooks. Timestone (coral) borers Aspidosiphon and Lithacrosiphon both have well-developed anal shields (calcified in Lithacrosiphon) and a right-angled introvert (P araspidosiphon). Phascolosoma: often has dark pigment patterns on introvert; includes wood-boring P turnerae, semiterrestrial P arcuatum from Indo-Pacific mangrove swamps, and nearshore P agassizii from U.S. Pacific Northwest.	
282	PERIPATOPSIDAE	ONYCHOPHORA			PERIPATOPSIDAE						Relatively primitive, restricted to temperate southern hemisphere (Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, South Africa, and Chile). 14 to 25 pairs of legs. Salivary gland lacks a reservoir. Coxal organs absent, crural glands in both sexes. Gonopores between the last pair of legs.

Batillipes, Echiniscus, Stygarctus, Tanarctus.	
285	MESOTARDIGRADA	TARDIGRADA			MESOTARDIGRADA						Thermozodium the only genus. Malpighian glands present. Legs with 6 to 10 simple claws.	
286	TRILOBITOMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA								Arthropods make their first appearance in the fossil record during the Cambrian period, along with most other modern invertebrate phyla. The earliest, best known, most common, and most abundant fossil arthropods were the Trilobitomorpha, or trilobites, whose closest living relatives are probably the chelicerates. Trilobitomorpha is monophyletic and has the body plan—including an exoskeleton, segmentation, paired segmental appendages, and compound eyes—expected ofearly arthropods. Trilobites were abundant and widely distributed in Paleozoic seas from the Lower Cambrian through the Permian, but are now extinct. They appeared suddenly early in the Cambrian period and reached the height of their distribution and abundance during the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, beginning about 540 mya (million years ago). Trilobites persisted for 300 million years until they disappeared at the end of the Permian, about 260 mya. Their fossils are so common and widespread and their species so characteristic of specific places and times that they are used by geologists as index fossils to identify and associate strata of sedimentary rocks in widely disparate localities and to arrange these strata in their proper geological sequence.	
287	REDLICHIIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		REDLICHIIDA						The most primitive known trilobites; ancestral to the other trilobites. Large, semicircular cephalon, strong genal spines, opisthoparian sutures. Glabella conspicuously segmented by deep glabellar furrows. Thorax well developed, with many segments. Eyes large. Pygidium small or vestigial. Appeared in Lower Cambrian, extinct by Middle Cambrian, having been replaced by their descendants. Olenellus, Olenoides, Paradoxides, Redlichia.	
288	AGNOSTIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		AGNOSTIDA						Primitive. Very small, < 8 mm long. Cephalon and pygidium large, similar in size and shape. Two or three thoracic segments. Usually blind. No facial sutures. May have been planktonic. Probably diverged early in the Cambrian from primitive redlichiid ancestors. Agnostus, Eodiscus, Pagetia.	
289	CORYNEXOCHIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		CORYNEXOCHIDA						Long glabella with parallel sides, sometimes flared anteriorly. Hypostome and rostrum (median region of doublure adjacent to hypostome) fused. Opisthoparian facial suture. Thorax of 5 to 11 segments. Pygidium medium to large. Genal spines present in many. Thorax often, pygidium sometimes spiny. Arose from redlichiid ancestors in late Cambrian. Illaenus, Olenoides, Polypleuraspis.	
290	PTYCHOPARIIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		PTYCHOPARIIDA						Large taxon with several well-known genera. Facial suture usually opisthoparian. Glabella simple, tapering anteriorly. Number of thoracic segments variable. Pygidium small in early species but generally large in derived species. Arose from redlichiid ancestors in Middle Cambrian. Probably ancestral to several orders that persisted after the Cambrian. Elrathia, Olenus, Shumardia, Triarthrus, Tricrepicephalus.	
291	ASAPHIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		ASAPHIDA						Recently established taxon related to Ptychopariida. Most had median ventral suture. Swollen, globular protaspis larva. Arose from ptychopariid ancestors in Middle Cambrian. An important taxon until the end of the Ordovician. A few persisted through Silurian. Asaphus, Cyclopyge, Isotelus, Ogygiocarella, Trinucleus.	
292	PHACOPIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		PHACOPIDA						Large taxon. Glabella often widened anteriorly. Facial suture proparian or gonatoparian, but sutures are fused and did not separate during ecdysis. Thorax of 8 to 19 segments. Medium to large semicircular pygidium. Probably evolved from asaphid or ptychopariid ancestors in Lower Ordovician. Phacopina are the only trilobites with schizochroal eyes. Calymene, Ceraurinella, Ceraurus, Eldredgeops (formerly Phacops), Staurocephalus.	
293	PROETIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		PROETIDA						Most have strong genal spines, large glabellae, opisthoparian sutures, 8 to 10 thoracic segments. Pygidium medium-sized. The only taxon surviving the Devonian extinctions to persist into the Carboniferous and Permian. Arose from Upper Cambrian ptychopariid ancestors. Bathyurus, Ditomopyge, Phaetonellus, Proetus.	
294	LICHIDA	ARTHROPODA	TRILOBITOMORPHA		LICHIDA						Pygidium larger than cephalon. Usually spiny or tuberculate. Medium to very large. Glabella prominent, with large lobes. Sutures opisthoparian. Thorax has 8 to 11 segments. Pygidium variable. Evolved from Middle Cambrian redlichiid ancestors. Dicranurus, Lichas, Odontopleura, Terataspis.	
295	CHELICERATA	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA								Chelicerata and Mandibulata are the two sister taxa of modern arthropods. Chelicerata, with about 70,000 known living species, includes spiders, scorpions, harvestmen, mites, and horseshoe crabs as well as the sea spiders and extinct sea scorpions. Most modern chelicerates are terrestrial and form one of the two major taxa of land arthropods. The original arthropods were aquatic animals from which descended two distinct evolutionary lines, Chelicerata and Mandibulata, each of which independently produced highly successful terrestrial lineages.	
296	XIPHOSURA	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		XIPHOSURA						Xiphosura and Arachnida, sister taxa of Euchelicerata, are represented today by horseshoe crabs, spiders, scorpions, and their relatives. In contrast with that of pycnogonids, the euchelicerate abdomen is well developed and often segmented. The cephalothoracic segments are fused and covered by a continuous sclerite, the carapace. Euchelicerates have retained the ancestral lateral compound eyes, although they may be highly modified. They have lost one of the two pairs of median eyes and their gonopores are on the second abdominal segment.	
297	ARACHNIDA	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA						Almost all recent chelicerates are arachnids, of which there are about 70,000 described species and an estimated million or more awaiting discovery. The taxon includes well-known animals such as spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks as well as many less familiar taxa. There are about 11 major taxa of arachnids, but over 80% of species are either spiders or mites. Almost all arachnids are terrestrial carnivores. Arachnida includes Scorpiones (scorpions), Palpigradi (palpigrades, or microwhip scorpions), Uropygi (whip scorpions, or vinegaroons, and schizomids), Araneae (spiders), Amblypygi (amblypygids), Pseudoscorpiones (false scorpions), Solifugae (solifuges, or solpugids), Opiliones (harvestmen, or daddy longlegs), Ricinulei (ricinuleids, or tick spiders), and Acari (mites and ticks), all of which are orders in Linnean classifications.	
298	SCORPIONES	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	SCORPIONES					Scorpions belong to an ancient taxon with a fossil record beginning in the Silurian period. Silurian and Devonian scorpions were aquatic, had gills, and lacked claws on the legs. Terrestrial scorpions appeared in the Devonian. The 1200 described species of Recent scorpions are most common in the tropics and subtropics, but occur on all continents except Antarctica. In the Western Hemisphere, they are found from southern Canada to southern South America and in North America are most abundant in the southeast and southwest.	
299	UROPYGI	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	UROPYGI					The approximately 100 described species of Uropygi are called whip scorpions. Some are large, and the American vinegaroon Mastigoproctus giganteus reaches 80 mm in length. The cephalothorax is completely covered by a carapace that bears a pair of anterior median eyes and three or four pairs of lateral eyes. Uropygid chelicerae are small and have two articles. The distal article forms a fang that folds against the large basal article. The large, raptorial pedipalps are stout and heavy, and short in comparison with the legs. The last two articles of the pedipalps may be modified to form a pincer used in seizing prey. During feeding, the prey is seized and torn apart by the pedipalps and then passed to the chelicerae. The animal holds its pedipalps and long, tactile first legs in front as it moves forward. The antenniform, sensory first legs touch the ground repeatedly.	
300	AMBLYPYGI	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	AMBLYPYGI					Amblypygids, or whip spiders, are tropical and semitropical arachnids resembling spiders in many aspects. Several of the 100 known species are common, but because they are secretive nocturnal animals, hiding during the day beneath logs, bark, stones, leaves, and similar objects, they typically escape notice Amblypygids range in length from 4 to 45 mm and have a dark, somewhat flattened, spiderlike body.	
301	MESOTHELAE	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ARANEAE					With the probable exception of mites and ticks, Araneae (spiders) is the largest arachnid taxon. Approximately 40,000 species in about 100 families and 3000 genera have been described, and it has been estimated that there are probably at least 170,000 species alive in the world today. Spider population densities can be very large, and in one study a hectare of undisturbed, grassy meadow in Great Britain was found to support over 5 million spiders. The great success of spiders relative to other arachnids probably results from their innovative use of silk. Many aspects of spider biology depend on silk, and it may be the adaptive equivalent of flight by insects in that both innovations resulted in extensive adaptive radiation culminating in great diversity. Spiders are, with few exceptions, terrestrial and occur on all continents except Antarctica. They are found in most terrestrial habitats but are absent from the sea, and there is only one freshwater species that lives below the water surface. Spiders are easily distinguished from most other arachnid orders by the distinctive pedicel between the cephalothorax and abdomen. Spiders are also the only arachnids with silk-spinning appendages, the spinnerets, on the posterior abdomen. Spiders are strictly carnivorous.	
302	MESOTHELAE	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ARANEAE	MESOTHELAE				Abdomen has segmental tergites and sternites. Seven or eight spinnerets, the first located at the level of the second pair of book lungs. Orthognath chelicerae. About 40 extant species in one taxon, the tropical Asian Liphistiidae.

303	MYGALOMORPHAE	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ARANEAE	MYGALOMORPHAE				Abdominal segmentation not externally apparent. Two pairs of book lungs. Six spinnerets. Fangs are orthognath, moving in a plane parallel to the long body axis.

Most stalk or ambush prey, a few are web builders. Many are very large. Atrax robustus, with fangs that can penetrate a fingernail, is said to be the world’s deadliest spider. About 2200 extant species in 15 families, many North American.	
304	ARANEOORPHAE	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ARANEAE	ARANEOORPHAE				Fangs are not orthognath. Abdomen is not segmented. One pair of book lungs in most species. Cribellum and calamistrum present primitively, but lost in most. 90 families with 32,000 species.

322	PISAURIDAE	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ARANEAE	PISAURIDAE				Fishing and nursery spiders. Large cursorial hunters similar to wolf spiders, but with longer legs. Common around fresh water and move efficiently on, and sometimes under, the water surface to capture prey. Dolomedes, Pisaura, Thalssius, Tinus.	
323	AGELENIDAE	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ARANEAE	AGELENIDAE				Funnel weaver, or grass, spiders. Spin sheet webs with a funnel-shaped retreat. Prey are captured on the sheet.

Corythalia, Gertschia, Menemerus, Neon, Phidippus, Salticus, Trite.	
329	PALPIGRADI	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	PALPIGRADI					The 70 known species of palpigrades are mostly less than 1.5 mm in length and none are larger than 3 mm. Microwhip scorpions are blind, interstitial soil arachnids occurring primarily in tropical and subtropical habitats but also in European subterranean environments. Many of their unusual characteristics, including their size, are adaptations for life in small spaces.	
330	PSEUDOSCORPIONES	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	PSEUDOSCORPIONES					This taxon consists of small arachnids rarely exceeding 7mm in length and usually less than half that. Pseudoscorpions are widespread in leaf litter, under bark, in soil, and in moss and debris, where they are seldom noticed despite being very common. One species, Chelifer ccincroides, lives in human houses and is known as the book scorpion. About 2500 species are known worldwide. This distinct and homogeneous taxon has no close ties to other arachnids, except possibly the solifuges. Their resemblance to true scorpions is superficial and due solely to their common (convergent) possession of large chelate pedipalps. Pseudoscorpions move rapidly backward, although some also move forward and some, sideways. They exhibit a phenomenon known as phoresy, in which they grasp the leg of an insect with their pedipalps and hitch a ride as it flies to a new habitat.	
331	SOLIFUGAE	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	SOLIFUGAE					Solifuges form a taxon of about 800 to 1000 tropical and semi tropical arachnids, sometimes called sun spiders because of their spider like appearance and diurnal habits or wind spiders because of the great speed of the males. In the United States, a few species have been found in Florida and more than 100 have been found in the southwest, some as far north as Colorado. Many solifuges are common in warm, arid regions of the world, but they are also known from grasslands and forests. Solifuges hide under stones and in crevices and many dig burrows. Their length ranges from a few millimeters to as much as 7 cm. The cephalothorax is covered dorsally by a large anterior carapace bearing a pair of closely placed median eyes on the anterior border and a short posterior carapace, or tergum. The hinge between the anterior and posterior carapaces is flexible. The segmented abdomen is large and joined to the cephalothorax by a slightly narrowed waist.	
332	OPILIONES	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	OPILIONES					Opiliones, or Phalangida, contains the familiar long-legged arachnids known as daddy longlegs or harvestmen. The 5000 or more described species live in temperate and tropical climates and most prefer humid habitats. Harvestmen are abundant in vegetation, on the forest floor, on tree trunks and fallen logs, in humus, and in caves. They do not produce silk or toxins and they do not bite, although they may (rarely) pinch. The widespread belief that harvestmen have a highly toxic venom is due to their being confused with pholcid spiders, which also go by the name “daddy longlegs.” These spiders resemble harvestmen but have a potent toxin, although their chelicerae are too small and weak to envenomate humans. Most harvestmen are predators but, unlike almost all other arachnids, many are herbivores, and many feed on dead organic material. Also unlike other arachnids, they are capable of ingesting particulate food. In fact, since the pharynx pedipalps and passed to the chelicerae, which hold and crush it. Unlike other arachnids, the ingested food is not limited to liquid material, but includes small particles. Thus, a greater part of digestion must take place in the midgut. The mouth is preceded by the preoral cavity, which is bounded dorsally by the labrum, ventrally by the labium, and laterally by the gnathobases of the pedipalps and first legs.	
333	RICINULEI	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	RICINULEI					Ricinulei includes about 75 species of small, uncommon arachnids known as tick spiders found in Africa (Ricinoides) and the Americas (Cryptocellus) from Brazil to the southern United States, where they have been collected from leaf litter and in caves. Ricinuleids are heavy-bodied and small, measuring up to 10 mm in length. The cuticle is very thick, heavily sclerotized, and often sculptured. Attached to the anterior margin of the carapace is a unique, hoodlike cucullus that can be raised and lowered. When lowered, it covers the preoral cavity, mouth, and chelicerae. Ricinuleids are blind, but Tiave lateral light-sensitive spots. Unlike the three-part chelicerae of the Acari (mites), tick spider chelicerae have only two articles. The pedipalps are chelate, the second legs are sensory, and the male third legs are used to transfer sperm to the female gonopore. The cephalothorax and 10-segment abdomen are broadly joined. The anterior abdominal segments are wide, but the posterior segments are small and telescoping, with the anus on the 10th segment.	
334	ACARI	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ACARI					The extraordinarily diverse taxon Acari contains about 40,000 known species of mites and ticks, with conservative estimates of another million waiting to be discovered. From the standpoint of health and economics these are the arachnids most important to humans. Although most mites are free-living, numerous species are parasitic on people, domesticated animals, and crops. Many others are destructive to stored food and other products. Mites are among the most ubiquitous animals, and free-living, terrestrial species are extremely abundant, particularly on plants and in mosses, leaf litter, humus, soil, rotten wood, and detritus. Population densities are enormous, certainly surpassing all other arachnid orders. A handful of leaf litter from a forest floor often contains hundreds of individuals belonging to tens of species. Mites are the only arachnids with a significant presence in aquatic habitats and they are common in both marine and fresh waters. Despite their abundance and economic importance, mites are not as well known as the other arachnids.	
335	ACARIFORMES	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ACARI	ACARIFORMES				The “mitelike” mites.The most diverse mite taxon, with over 30,000 species. Indirect development. Setae have optically active, birefringent actinochitin. Trichobothria are present. Includes Astigmata, Endeostigmata, Oribatida, Sarcoptiformes, and Trombidiformes (Prostigmata). Belba, Demodex, Dermatophagoides, Mideopsis, Neotrombicula, Sarcoptes, Tetranychus, Trombicula, Trombidium, Tydeus.	
336	OPILIOACARIDA	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		ARACHNIDA	ACARI	OPILIOACARIDA				Large, rare, leathery, primitive mites. Segmented abdomen. Trichobothria are absent. Resemble opilionids.

338	PYCNOGONIDA	ARTHROPODA	CHELICERATA		PYCNOGONIDA						Pycnogonida, or Pantopoda, is a taxon (class or superclass) of about 1000 described species of exclusively marine animals known as sea spiders. Pycnogonids are not spiders, however, and the name is based on superficial similarities, such as eight long legs and a small body. Although largely unnoticed, sea spiders actually are common benthic animals that occur from the intertidal zone to the deep sea. They live in all oceans from the poles to the tropics. Careful examination of bryozoans and hydroids scraped from a wharf piling or rocks usually yields a few specimens. Most are bottom dwellers that crawl about over irregular substrates as if on stilts. Some can swim by flapping their legs alternately up and down. A few are pelagic, some are interstitial, and some are commensal or ectoparasitic on other invertebrates.	
339	REMIPEDIA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		REMIPEDIA						The first known remipede, Speleonectes lucayensis, was described in 1981 and the taxon is now represented by 10 species in six genera, all from under sea caves primarily in the Bahamas, West Indies, and Yucatan Peninsula. So far, all representatives have been found in water filled caves connecting with the sea at one end and with freshwater ponds at the other. The body of these 15- to 45-mm-long marine crustaceans is elongate, resembling that of a polychaete, with numerous biramous appendages. Powerful rowing strokes of the trunk appendages produce rhythmic preferred by MW waves that sweep along the length of the body for swimming. Remipedes are carnivores or scavengers. The body includes a trunk and a cephalothorax, the latter of which is covered by a sclerotized carapace (cephalic shield). Eyes do not seem to be present, although sometimes there are vestigial eye like structures. Suppression or loss of eyes is a common adaptation in cave dwelling animals. The large first antennae are biramous and bear chemosensory aesthetascs. The much smaller second antennae are paddlelike.	
340	CEPHALOCARIDA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		CEPHALOCARIDA						Cephalocarids conform closely to the hypothesized ancestral crustacean in that they are epibenthic deposit feeders with undifferentiated trunk appendages. The nine known species have been collected in sand and mud from the high subtidal to depths of 1550 m in many parts of the world. The first was found in Long Island Sound in 1953. Cephalocarids are tiny crustaceans of less than 4 mm in length.	
341	ANOSTRACA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		ANOSTRACA						This relatively small taxon inhabits inland, but not necessarily fresh, waters. Anostraca includes the fairy and brine shrimps, both of which are confined to relictual habitats from which fishes are excluded either because the habitat dries up periodically or because the water is too saline. Brine shrimps, whose eggs are creatively marketed with the claim they will hatch into “sea monkeys,” are familiar to many people.	
342	PHYLLOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA						Phvllopoda includes about 800 species of mostly freshwater crustaceans. It is convenient to distinguish, for purposes of discussion, between the “large” and “small” phyllopodans. Large phyllopodans are the tadpole shrimps (Notostraca) and clam shrimps (Spinicaudata and Laevicaudata). Like anostracans, large species are restricted to relictual habitats where they are free of fish predation. Such habitats are typically ephemeral (temporary) ponds, ditches, cave pools, and alkaline lakes from which fishes are excluded, either by the temporary nature of the habitat or its chemistry. The life cycle may be adapted to alternating periods of desiccation and flooding, with dry periods being passed in the egg stage. The most successful, however, are the small phyllopodans, the water fleas, or Cladocera. Unlike large phyllopodans, they are not restricted to relictual habitats and are ecologically important members of benthic and planktonic communities of lakes.	
343	NOTOSTRACA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		NOTOSTRACA				Notostraca consists of only 10 species of benthic tadpole shrimps in the genera Triops and Lepidurus that are found in quiet, inland, fish-free waters. Notostracans resemble anostracans in some respects, but the similarities are now thought to be superficial and due to convergence. The body consists of ahead, thorax, and abdomen, with no secondary tagmosis. An enormous depressed, shieldlike carapace covers the head, thorax, and most of the abdomen. Sessile compound eyes are present on the anterior carapace. The mandibles are large and triturative.	
344	LAEVICAUDATA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		LAEVICAUDATA				These two taxa with several superficial similarities were formerly grouped together in Gonchostraca, or clam shrimps, but are no longer thought to belong to a monophyletic taxon. Nevertheless, it is still convenient to refer to them unofficially as “conchostraca.” The 200 extant described species are characterized by the large, bivalved carapace that encloses the entire body so that, when viewed from the outside, the animal resembles a small clam. The carapace is laterally compressed, unlike that of notostracans, and equipped with a strong transverse adductor muscle.	
345	SPINICAUDATA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		SPINICAUDATA				These two taxa with several superficial similarities were formerly grouped together in Gonchostraca, or clam shrimps, but are no longer thought to belong to a monophyletic taxon. Nevertheless, it is still convenient to refer to them unofficially as “conchostraca.” The 200 extant described species are characterized by the large, bivalved carapace that encloses the entire body so that, when viewed from the outside, the animal resembles a small clam. The carapace is laterally compressed, unlike that of notostracans, and equipped with a strong transverse adductor muscle.	
346	CLADOCERA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		CLADOCERA				Cladocera contains 11 families, with about 600 species, of similar microcrustaceans known collectively as water fleas. In the new classification, Cladocera (Cladoceromorpha) has been divided into four new taxa, Anomopoda, Ctenopoda, Onychopoda, and Haplopoda. Cladocerans have a carapace that serves as a dorsal brood pouch. In most, the carapace is large and bivalved to enclose the trunk, but in some it is reduced to no more than the brood pouch. The compound eyes are fused to form a single movable eye equipped with muscles. There may also be a small median naupliar eye. The second antennae are large and are the major swimming organs. The first antennae are tiny.	
347	ANOMOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		CLADOCERA	ANOMOPODA			Trunk is short and enclosed by a well-developed, hingeless, laterally compressed, bivalve carapace. Head is expanded dorsally and laterally to form a head shield. Trunk is short, its segments fused. Five or six pairs of dissimilar trunk appendages which do not beat in metachronal waves. Postabdomen reflexed anteriorly under trunk. Postabdomen has a pair of long setae and a pair of large terminal claws. Development is direct; hatch as miniature adults. Resting eggs enclosed in ephippium derived from the carapace. Freshwater. Nine families including Bosminidae, Chydoridae, Daphniidae, Macrothricidae, and Moinidae. The majority of cladocerans are anomopods. Alona, Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Chydorus, Daphnia, Macrothrix, Moina, Scapholeberis.	
348	CTENOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		CLADOCERA	CTENOPODA			Similar to anomopods. Short trunk is enclosed by well-developed, laterally compressed, bivalve carapace lacking a true hinge. No head shield. Six pairs of similar trunk appendages beat in rhythmic waves. Post abdomen has a pair of long setae and a pair of large terminal claws. Development is direct; hatch as miniature adults. Chiefly freshwater, but one marine genus. Two families, Holopediidae and Sididae. Holopedium, Sida.	
349	ONYCHOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		CLADOCERA	ONYCHOPODA			Do not closely resemble anomopods or ctenopods. Head and trunk are short. Carapace is reduced, represented only by dorsal brood pouch; does not enclose trunk. Development is direct. Freshwater, marine predators. Trunk appendages raptorial, adapted for grasping rather than filtering. Includes Cercopagidae, Podonidae, Polyphemidae. Bythotrephes, Evadne, Podon, Polyphemus.	
350	HAPLOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		PHYLLOPODA		CLADOCERA	HAPLOPODA			Very different from other cladocerans. Elongate head and body. Carapace is a dorsal brood pouch in females, absent in males. Freshwater zooplanktivores. Much larger than other cladocerans, up to 18 mm. Anterior trunk.appendages are raptorial and adapted for grasping smaller zooplankters. Development indirect, hatching stage is a metanauplius. Leptodoridae the only family, Leptodora kindtii the only species.	
351	MALACOSTRACA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA						Large and successful Malacostraca, with 23,000 living species, contains over half of the known species of crustaceans. It includes most of the large well-known crustaceans, such as crabs, lobsters, crayfishes, and shrimps, in addition to an abundance of small but ecologically important species. Unlike other crustacean taxa, tagmosis, with few exceptions, is standardized.	
352	LEPTOSTRACA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		LEPTOSTRACA				Leptostracans, or phyllocarids, are small, benthic marine malacostracans. They look like tiny shrimps enclosed in an enormous carapace. About 20 species occur worldwide and range in length from 10 to 40 mm. Except for a single planktonic species, all are benthic and found from the intertidal to the deep sea. Species of Nebalia occur in mud and seaweed on the both coasts of North America.	
353	STOMATOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		STOMATOPODA				The 300 species of marine crustaceans known as mantis shrimps constitute Stomatopoda. Mantis shrimp are highly specialized predators of fishes, crabs, shrimps, and molluscs, and many of their distinctive features are related to their raptorial behavior. The dorsoventrally depressed body is divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen and there is no cephalothorax. The head bears a pair of large, stalked compound eyes and a single median naupliar eye. The first antennae are unusual in being triramous, with three flagella. Each second antenna consists of a peduncle, flagellum, and large antennal scale. Dorsally, a shieldlike carapace covers the head and first four thoracic segments. A movable median rostrum articulates with the anterior edge of the carapace and covers the bases of the eyestalks.	
354	DECAPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		DECAPODA				Decapoda includes shrimps, crayfishes, lobsters, and crabs and are certainly the most familiar crustaceans. Most decapods are large and many are edible and support important fisheries. The approximately 10,000 described species represent about one-quarter of the known crustaceans. Because of their large size, abundance, and ecological and economic importance, decapods are the most carefully studied and best-known crustaceans. Most are marine and benthic, but the crayfishes and some shrimps and crabs have invaded fresh water A few crabs are terrestrial and some decapods are planktonic.	
355	SYNCARIDA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		SYNCARIDA				Syncarida is represented by about 50 species of primitive crustaceans in two taxa, Anaspidacea and Bathynellacea. Some fossil syncaridans are known from marine habitats, but all Recent species are freshwater.	
356	ANASPIDACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		SYNCARIDA	ANASPIDACEA			Anaspidaceans are shrimp like syncaridans with many primitive characteristics. Segments and appendages are only moderately specialized. The first thoracic segment bears maxillipeds and is fused with the head to form a small cephalothorax, but there is no carapace. The remaining thoracic appendages are similar to each other. The abdomen consists of six segments with up to five pairs of pleopods. Pleopods 1 and 2 of the male are intromittent organs, and fertilization is internal. The telson and a pair of uropods are on the sixth abdominal segment. Anaspidaceans inhabit relictual fresh-water habitats where there are few or no predators. They are found in caves, streams, and lakes in Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Several live in crayfish burrows and many inhabit lacustrine vegetation beds. Anaspidaceans are suspension feeders or omnivores, and the largest is 5 cm in length.	
357	BATHYNELLACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		SYNCARIDA	BATHYNELLACEA			Bathynellaceans are elongate, blind, interstitial or groundwater syncaridans. Most occur in fresh water or, in a few instances, brackish water. Thermobathynella occurs in hot springs at temperatures of up to 55°C. The body is small and vermiform with reduced appendages, as is characteristic of interstitial animals. The tagmata are a head, thorax, and abdomen with no secondary tagmosis. The thorax consists of eight segments, but none is fused with the head. Cephalothorax, maxillipeds, and carapace are absent. Thoracic appendages 1 through 7 are similar and biramous. The eighth thoracopod is reduced or absent. The last of the six abdominal segments is fused with the telson to form a pleotelson. Abdominal appendages, with the exception of a pair of uropods on the pleotelson, are reduced or absent.	
358	EUPHAUSIACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		EUPHAUSIACEA				Euphausiaceans, or krill, are pelagic crustaceans approximately 3 cm in length. All 85 described species are marine. Like primitive decapods, krill have a shrimplike body with a highly developed carapace fused with all thoracic segments. Unlike the decapods, however, the euphausiacean carapace does not extend ventrally beyond the bases of the legs. It does not form a branchial chamber and the gills are exposed. The thoracic legs are biramous and the gills are filamentous epipods on the protopod. The thoracic exopods move rhythmically to ventilate the gills. Although there are eight pairs of thoracic appendages, the eighth, and sometimes the seventh, are reduced. The second pair of thoracopods may be raptorial in carnivorous species, but maxillipeds are absent. Pleopods, uropods, and telson resemble those of shrimps.	
359	MYSIDACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		PANCARIDA	MYSIDACEA			Mysidaceans are small, shrimphke peracarids of freshwater, brackish, and marine habitats. Most are 2 to 30 mm in length, but the bathypelagic Gnathophausia may reach 35 cm. Some are important members of northern lakes, but most are marine; they may be benthic or pelagic.	
360	AMPHIPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		PANCARIDA	AMPHIPODA			Amphipods are small crustaceans often found in large numbers and high diversity in aquatic habitats. With more than 6000 species, Amphipoda is the largest peracaridan taxon. Most amphipods are marine, but many are found in fresh water and one family has terrestrial and semiterrestrial species. In the sea they are common, diverse, and ecologically important in pelagic and benthic habitats.	
361	GAMMARIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		PANCARIDA	AMPHIPODA	GAMMARIDEA		The largest amphipod taxon, Gammaridea, includes about 5000 of the 6000 amphipod species. These are the “typical” amphipods most like the stem amphipod. Gammarideans usually are laterally compressed, although some are dorsoventrally depressed. Most are benthic and usually remain closely associated with the bottom despite being capable of swimming. Typical gammarideans have large coxal plates, a large abdomen with six pairs of appendages, and relatively small compound eyes. The first thoracic segment is fused with the head to form a cephalothorax.	
362	HYPERIIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		PANCARIDA	AMPHIPODA	HYPERIIDEA		Hyperiidea is a taxon of about 500 species of pelagic marine amphipods. What little is known of their life histories suggests that all hyperiideans spend at least part of the life cycle as commensals or parasites of gelatinous zooplankters such as salps, siphonophores, jellyfishes, and ctenophores. For example, members of Phronimidae live in the barrel-shaped tunic of salps, which they propel through the water.	
363	CAPRELLIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		PANCARIDA	AMPHIPODA	CAPRELLIDEA		Species of the aptly named skeleton shrimps are highly derived, strictly marine benthic amphipods adapted for a life of clinging to complex substrata such as sea weeds, bryozoans, and hydroids. Most are lie-in-wait predators of small invertebrates, but some consume epiphytic diatoms. There are about 350 extant described species. The body, which bears little resemblance to that of other amphipods, is elongate, sticklike, cylindrical, and not laterally compressed. The second thoracic segment is partially fused with the head to create a cephalothorax consisting of the head plus two thoracic segments. The first thoracic appendages are maxillipeds, as usual, but those of the second remain gnathopods. The third thoracic segment bears the second pair of gnathopods. Thoracic segments 4 and 5 bear slender, reduced or vestigial pereopods, gills, and, infemales, largeoostegites. The marsupium is thus restricted to the middle of the thorax on the fourth and fifth thoracic segments. Thoracic appendages 6 through 8 are well-developed, subchelate prehensile legs used to cling tenaciously to the substratum. Coxae are reduced or vestigial. The abdomen consists of five small segments with vestigial appendages.	
364	INGOLFIELLIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		PANCARIDA	AMPHIPODA	INGOLFIELLIDEA		Ingolfiellideans, some of which are less than 1 mm long, are adapted for interstitial habitats in both marine and freshwater environments. The body is cylindrical and the thorax and abdomen are well developed. The pleopods are vestigial, but the first two pairs of uropods are strong. The 30 known species occur in hypogean (subterranean), interstitial, and deep-sea habitats. Their small size, loss of eyes and pigmentation, vermiform shape, and reduced appendages are familiar adaptations for life in interstitial habitats. Ingolfiella.	
365	CUMACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		CUMACEA				Cumaceans are small inhabitants of sand and mud bottoms. The taxon is small, with about 800 species of distinctively tadpole-shaped and easily recognized marine peracaridans. Most are about 1 mm in length, and the largest is about 4 mm. They reach their greatest diversity and ecological significance in the deep sea.	
366	MICTACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		MICTACEA				Mictacea was described in 1985 and is now known from two small, subcylindrical species: Hirsutia bathyalis from 1000 m in the North Atlantic and South Pacific and Mictocarishalope from Bermudan sea caves. The largest is 3.5 mm in length. The first thoracomere is fused with the head and its appendages are maxillipeds. The carapace covers only the first thoracomere. The seven pereopods are biramous with setose exopods used primarily for swimming. Oostegites are present on most pereopods of females and form a marsupium. The six-segmented abdomen bears reduced pleopods on its first five segments and well-developed uropods and a telson on the sixth. Mictaceans probably are detritivores, but little is known of their biology.	
367	TANAIDACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		TANAIDACEA				Tanaidaceans are small, marine, benthic crustaceans. Most of the approximately 700 described species are only 2 to 5 mm in length, although one reaches 12 cm. The body is elongate and cylindrical or depressed in cross section. The head is fused with the first two thoracic segments to form a cephalothorax, which is covered by a carapace. The appendages of the head thoracic segment form a maxilliped whereas those of the second are chelipeds, which may be very large. Chelipeds on the second thoracic segment are a distinctive feature of tanaidaceans. The remaining six thoracic segments form the pereon and their appendages are pereopods. In many tanaidaceans, silk glands in the pereon open at pores at the tips of several anterior pereopods. Silk is used in tube construction and for draglines. Female pereopods 1 to 4 usually bear oostegites that form a marsupium. Some have oostegites only on the fourth pereopods.	
368	SPELAEOGRIPHACEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		SPELAEOGRIPHACEA				This small taxon of subterranean peracaridans includes only three known species: Spelaeogriphus lepidops from Bat Cave in Table Mountain, South Africa; the Brazilian Potiicoara brasiliensis; and Mangkurtu mityula from Western Australia. The body is long and cylindrical and may reach up to 9 mm in length. The head thoracomere is fused with the head and bears maxillipeds. A small carapace extends posteriorly to cover the second thoracomere and part of the third. Most of the seven pereopods are biramous and their exopods are gills. Females have oostegites on the first five pereopods. The abdomen has six segments and the biramous, setose pleopods are mostly well developed and natatory, although the fifth is vestigial. The uropods are biramous. The biology and internal anatomy are poorly known.	
369	ISOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA				Most of the 4000 described species of isopods live in the sea, where they are widely distributed, diverse, abundant, and ecologically important in most benthic habitats. In addition, many are found in freshwater benthic communities, including interstitial, hypogean, and epigean habitats. The wood lice, or pill bugs, are the most successful terrestrial crustaceans. The taxon includes many parasitic species, including two exclusively parasitic higher taxa. They have, however, no pelagic representatives equivalent to the hyperiidean amphipods. Among crustaceans, Isopoda is exceeded only by the copepods, decapods, and amphipods in number of species. Most isopods are 5 to 15 mm in length, but the giant, deep-sea Bathynomus giganteus reaches a length of 42 cm and a width of 15 cm and some interstitial Microcerberus are only 1mm. Isopods resemble amphipods in several respects and are often compared—and sometimes confused—with them, but the similarities are probably convergent. Amphipods tend to be laterally compressed whereas most isopods are dorsoventrally depressed.	
370	FLABELLIFERA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	FLABELLIFERA			A large, diverse, important taxon of chiefly marine, benthic isopods. The majority of shallow-water, marine, benthic isopods are flabelliferans. Body usually is depressed, often broadly arched in cross section. Many resemble terrestrial wood lice. A few freshwater species. Many are carnivores or parasites of fishes. Bathynomus, Cirolana, Cymothoa, Lirnnoria, Paracerceis, Sphaeroma, Rocinela.	
371	VALVIFERA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	VALVIFERA			Another important taxon of marine, benthic isopods. Uropods ventral to the pleotelson form opercula (valves) to enclose and protect branchial chamber and pieopods. Pleotelson often elongate. Erichsonella, Idotea.	
372	ASELLOTA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	ASELLOTA			Chiefly freshwater, but some deep-sea species. Most freshwater isopods are asellotes; both epigean (surface waters) and subterranean. Caecidotea, Lirceus, Munna.	
373	ANTHURIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	ANTHURIDEA			Chiefly shallow-water, marine, benthic. Mostly Southern Hemisphere. Body elongate, subcylindrical. Most burrow in soft sediments or occupy crevices in hard substrata. A few in hypogean freshwaters. Apanthura, Cyathura.	
374	PHERATOICIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	PHERATOICIDEA			Small taxon of amphipod-like freshwater isopods. Only in South Africa, India, New Zealand, and Australia. Feed on plant detritus. Nichollsia, Phreatoicus.	
375	ONISCOIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	ONISCOIDEA			Semiterrestrial and terrestrial isopods Some are so well adapted to terrestrial habitats that they inhabit deserts. Includes supratidal sea slaters and fully terrestrial wood lice, pill bugs, sow bugs. Herbivores. Armadillidium, Ligia, Oniscus, Porcellio, Tylos.	
376	MICROCERBERIDAE	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	MICROCERBERIDAE			Tiny interstitial isopods. Freshwater, shallow marine habitats. Vermiform, cylindrical in cross section, as is typical of interstitial animals. Microcerberus.	
377	GNATHIIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	GNATHIIDEA			Small taxon of parasitic marine isopods. Juvenile stages parasitic on fishes; adults do not feed. Adults subsist on fish blood stored in the digestive ceca as juveniles. Adults live in burrows constructed by the male. Some are viviparous, female retains and gestates developing embryos in ovaries. Gnathia, Paragnathia.	
378	EPICARIDEA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MALACOSTRACA		ISOPODA	EPICARIDEA			Large taxon of highly modified, parasitic, marine isopods. Sucking mouthparts; feed on blood of crustacean hosts. Asymmetrical female is highly modified for parasitism and barely recognizable as an isopod. Male is a dwarf, usually symmetrical and isopod-like. Some are hermaphroditic. Asymmetrione, Athelges, Bopyrus Cancricepon, Cyproniscus, Probopyrus.	
379	MAXILLOPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA						In most recent classifications, several taxa are grouped together in Maxillopoda. Those included vary with author, but in its broadest and most inclusive sense they are Copepoda, Mystacocarida, Tantulocarida, Ascothoracida, Cirripedia, Ostracoda, Branchiura, and Pentastomida. Maxillopodans are small crustaceans (usually microcrustaceans)with a short trunk.	
380	COPEPODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		COPEPODA				Approximately 12,000 described species of extant copepods make this one of the largest crustacean higher taxa, second only to Malacostraca. Most copepods are marine, but there are many freshwater species and a few terrestrial forms live in moss, soil-water films, and leaf litter. Parasitic copepods attack various marine and freshwater animals, particularly fish. The enormous numbers of marine copepods are almost always the most abundant and conspicuous component of a plankton sample. Copepoda is one of the three taxa that dominate the fresh water zooplankton.It has been suggested that copepods are the most abundant metazoans on Earth, with more individuals (but not species) than insects. Because most planktonic species feed on phytoplankton, copepods are the principal and essential link between the world’s most important producers (marine phytoplankton) and higher trophic levels in pelagic marine food chains. Copepods are a major part of the diet of many marine animals.	
381	MYSTACOCARIDA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		MYSTACOCARIDA				Mystacocarida is a small taxon of marine interstitial crustaceans believed to be closely related to copepods. The two share their complete lack of compound eyes, the absence of a carapace, and a 10-segmented trunk. Mystacocarida was first described in 1943 from specimens collected off Massachusetts, and 10 additional species have since been reported from many other coasts, principally around the North and South Atlantic. Most are 0.5 to 1.0 mm in length and adapted for living in the interstices between sand grains in the intertidal zone. The body is long, cylindrical, and vermiform, like that of many other interstitial animals.	
382	TANTULOCARIDA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		TANTULOCARIDA				First described in 1983, Tantulocarida includes a growing number (12 species at present) of marine ectoparasites of deep-water copepods, isopods, and ostracods highly specialized for a parasitic life. These are tiny animals, as a copepod parasite would have to be, that do not exceed 1 mm in length, with most being about 0.5 mm. They are gonochoric and sexually dimorphic. The male has a gonopod derived from trunk appendages, and fertilization is thought to be internal. There are sexual and parthenogenetic life cycles connected by a larval stage.	
383	ASLOTHORACIDA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		ASLOTHORACIDA				Aslothoracida, Acrothoracica, Thoracica, and Rhizocephala constitute the undisputedly monophyletic taxon of Thecostraca. Thoracica, Rhizocephala, and Acrothoracica are highly derived, bear little resemblance to other crustaceans, and are grouped together in Cirripedia, the barnacles. Ascothoracida has crustacean-like males and aberrant females, and is the sister taxon of Cirripedia. The thecostracan larval compound eye has a three-part crystalline cone formed by three cone cells. Compound eyes are absent in adults and the second antennae are vestigial or absent. The first antennae are attachment organs and the carapace tends to be large and bivalved unless it has been secondarily lost. Adults are usually sessile, and commensalism and parasitism have arisen several times. An abdomen is present in only the most primitive taxa. Development includes distinctive nauplius and cypris larvae. Ascothoracidans are the most primitive thecostracans. Rhizocephalans are the most derived and look nothing like crustaceans. A fifth thecostracan taxon, the enigmatic Facetotecta, has been known since 1899 from cosmopolitan, planktonic “Y-larvae,” both nauplii and cyprids, for which adults have never been found. The cyprids of all thecostracan higher taxa have five pairs of chemosensory lattice organs on the carapace, each consisting of a noval cuticular plate penetrated by a large terminal pore and sometimes by a field of tiny pores. Lattice organs are thought to be highly derived setae used to recognize appropriate substrata prior to settling.	
384	CIRRIPEDIA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		CIRRIPEDIA				Cirripedia includes the familiar benthic marine animals known as barnacles as well as some unfamiliar and bizarre parasites. These strange and derived creatures have many characteristics that set them apart from other crustaceans. They inhabit a rigid calcareous shell (carapace or mantle) that grows without molting, many are hermaphroditic, and they are sessile. Barnacles have features in common with ostracod sand, in fact, resemble an ostracod turned upside down and stuck firmly to the substratum by its head and back. Cirripedes include the only nonparasitic sessile crustaceans, and their anatomy and biology have undergone extensive modifications as a consequence of this unique lifestyle.	
385	THORACICA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		CIRRIPEDIA	THORACICA			The thoracican cypris larva settles out of the plankton to the bottom and attaches to the substratum by means of cement glands located in the base of the first antennae. The larval carapace, which encloses the entire body, as it does in ostracods, persists and becomes an enveloping mantle (carapace) that encloses the adult barnacle. The mantle secretes thick calcareous plates that form a case to enclose and protect the barnacle. Since the cypris attaches by its head, the aperture (ventral opening) of the carapace is directed more or less upward and the trunk of the animal is upside down, with respect to the substratum, with its venter up.	
386	LEPADOMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		CIRRIPEDIA	THORACICA	LEPADOMORPHA		Of the three types of thoracican barnacles, the stalked barnacles (goose barnacles) are most primitive. The earliest known fossil barnacle is the stalked Cyprilepis, which was commensal on the appendages of sea scorpions (Eurypterida).	
387	LEPADIDAE	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		CIRRIPEDIA	THORACICA	LEPADOMORPHA	LEPADIDAE	Peduncle is naked (without calcareous plates); capitulum has only the five original, primary plates (one carina, two terga, and two scuta). Attach to floating objects, wood, coconuts, bottles, tar balls, and ships or are epizoic commensals. Includes the common, widely distributed Lepas species. Commensals include Conchoderma (on whales and turtles) and Alepas (on jellyfish). A related family of small, stalked barnacles (Poecilasmatidae) includes many common commensals such as Octolasmis muelleri, which lives on the gills of lobsters and crabs and takes advantage of the safety and flow of water in the branchial chamber of the host.	
388	SCALPELLIDAE	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		CIRRIPEDIA	THORACICA	LEPADOMORPHA	SCALPELLIDAE	Benthic, mostly deep water. Some, such as the common, eastern Pacific Pollicipes polymerus, live intertidally in dense aggregations on rocky coasts. Peduncle is covered with calcareous plates or scales, which generally increase in size toward the capitulum. One taxon is adapted for boring into coralline rock.	
389	BALANOMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		CIRRIPEDIA	THORACICA	BALANOMORPHA		The stalkless barnacles (balanomorphs and verrucomorphs) are thought to have arisen in the Jurassic from a scalpellid ancestor through the shortening and eventual disappearance of the peduncle.	
390	VERRUCOMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		CIRRIPEDIA	THORACICA	VERRUCOMORPHA		A third taxon of thoracican barnacles (wart barnacles) contains only about 30 species found chiefly in the deep sea. These stalkless barnacles resemble acorn barnacles but are asymmetrical. The operculum consists of only one tergum and one scutum, with the other tergum and scutum being incorporated into the wall.	
391	RHIZOCEPHALA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		RHIZOCEPHALA				Rhizocephalans are internal parasites of other crustaceans. Most of the 260 known species are parasitic on decapods, but a few are found on other crustaceans. Rhizocephalans are so highly specialized that almost all traces of arthropod structure have disappeared in the adult, although life begins with typical cirripede nauplius and cypris larvae. The soft, adult body is an amorphous sac and the mantle is not calcified. There is no sign of segmentation or appendages and almost all internal organs are lost. The position of Rhizocephala with respect to Cirripedia has been disputed, but morphological (similar nauplius and cypris larvae) and 18S rDNA nucleotide sequences support a sister relationship with Thoracica. Unlike thoracicans, however, rhizocephalans have no gut, no segmentation, no appendages and no calcareous plates, and are gonochoric.	
392	ACROTHORACIA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		ACROTHORACIA				The 40 known species of acrothoracicans are the smallest cirripedes, usually only a few millimeters in length. They bore into calcareous substrates such as coral, mollusc shells, other barnacles, bryozoans, and limestone using chitinous teeth on the mantle as well as chemical dissolution. The burrow openings are tiny, distinctive slits in the surface of the rock. The chitinous teeth are renewed with each molt. Unlike thoracicans, but like rhizocephalans, acrothoracicans are gonochoric and sexually dimorphic. Males are aberrant dwarfs that will be described separately. The following description refers to females.	
393	OSTRACODA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		OSTRACODA				Ostracods, or seed shrimps, are tiny microcrustaceans found in most aquatic habitats, both freshwater and marine. Ostracods are completely enclosed in a bivalve carapace and resemble seeds or minuscule clams. Although some, such as the neutrally buoyant Gigantocypris, are planktonic, most live on or near the bottom, where they swim intermittently or crawl over or plow through the upper layer of mud and detritus from the shoreline to great depths. In fresh water they occur in lakes, ponds, and hot springs. They may be suspension feeders, carnivores, detritivores, or herbivores. There are burrowing and interstitial species and species that live on algae, water plants, or other submerged objects. Some are commensal with other animals, living, for example, among the leg setae of cray-fishes or with polychaetes or echinoderms. Sphaeromicola is commensal with sub terranean isopods and Entocy thereliveson the gills of crayfishes. Elpidium lives in the leaf axils of epiphytic bromeliads. Most species are about 1 mm in size, but Microcythere minuta is only 25 mm, whereas Gigantocypris reaches 25 mm. About 6000 living species have been described, making it one of the largest crustacean taxa. The calcified, shell-like carapace is the source of the name“ostracod,”which is derived from the Greek word ostrakon (= shell).	
394	MYODOCOPA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		OSTRACODA	MYODOCOPA			Exclusively marine; benthic and planktonic. Valves have anterior antennal notch to accommodate the natatory antennae. Ventral valve margins are convex. Second antennae have well-developed natatory exopods and reduced endopods. Two pairs of trunk appendages. Cypridina, Gigantocypris, Halocypris, Polycope, Skogsbergia, Vargula.	
395	PODOCOPA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		OSTRACODA	PODOCOPA			Marine or fresh water, benthic. No antennal notch. Ventral valve margin is straight or concave. Two pairs of antennae with well-developed endopods and reduced exopods. Mandibles and first maxillae lack filtering setae. Second maxillae are sometimes leglike. One or two pairs of trunk appendages. All freshwater ostracods are podocopans. Intertidal, commensal, even a few terrestrial species. Candona, Cypris, Cythereis, Elpidium, Entocythere, Mesocypris, Microcythere, Sphaeromicola.	
396	PLATYCOPA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		OSTRACODA	PLATYCOPA			Closely related to Podocopa. Exclusively marine, benthic. Mandibles and first maxillae have filtering setae. Second antennae have well-developed endopods and exopods. First pair of trunk appendages are not leglike. Cytherella the only Recent genus.	
397	PALAECOPA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		OSTRACODA	PALAECOPA			Mostly fossil ostracods, but includes a few Recent species known only from empty valves.	
398	BRANCHIURA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		BRANCHIURA				Branchiurans, or fish lice, are intermittent ectoparasites on freshwater and marine fishes and occasionally tadpoles. The taxon includes a single family with approximately 200 species of flattened crustaceans that feed on fish blood and mucus and range in size between 5 and 30 mm, with most being 3 to 5 mm. Argulus, with over 100 species, is the largest genus.	
399	PENTASTOMIDA	ARTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MAXILLOPODA		PENTASTOMIDA				Pentastomids, or tongue worms, are derived, elongate, vermiform parasites of the nasal passages, sinuses, and lungs of vertebrates. About 100 species of these poorly understood animals have been described. All stages of the life cycle are obligatory parasites and most species require intermediate and definitive hosts. Approximately 90% parasitize reptiles, chiefly snakes, but also crocodiles and lizards. A few infect mammals and birds. Reptile parasites feed on blood, whereas those of mammals consume mucus and cells. There is usually a vertebrate, but sometimes an arthropod, intermediate host. Although largely tropical, pentastomids have been reported from North America, Europe, Australia, and even in Arctic birds.	
400	MYRIAPODA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA						Hexapods (insects), centipedes, and millipedes, along with their less well-known relatives the pauropods and symphylans, form a taxon known as Tracheata, which is one of the two great taxa of terrestrial arthropods (the other being Arachnida). The ancestral tracheate was a terrestrial mandibulate with tracheae and a body consisting of a series of similar, unspecialized segments like those of some Recent centipedes.	
401	CHILOPODA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		CHILOPODA				Although the name promises 100 legs, chilopods, or centipedes (centi = 100, ped = foot) have between 15 and 191 pairs of legs but, since the number of pairs is always odd, none has exactly 100. Centipedes are, along with millipedes, the most familiar myriapods. They are distributed throughout the world in both temperate and tropical regions from sea level to high elevations in soil and humus; beneath stones, bark, and logs; and in caves and mosses. Most are nocturnal, some are intertidal. Centipedes are poison-fanged raptors, and some large species will bite humans. The 2800 described species are assigned to five taxa.	
402	SCUTIGEROMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		CHILOPODA	SCUTIGEROMORPHA			Long legs, long antennae, well-developed pseudo faceted eyes. Some live in and around buildings. Scutigera coleoptrata, the cosmopolitan house centipede is sometimes found in an (empty) bathtub or washbasin or seen scurrying across the floor. Have 15 pairs of legs; extremely fast, fast enough to catch flies. Spiracles are dorsal, on the tergites. Open ground hunters rely on speed to capture prey. Earliest known centipede fossils are scutigeromorphs from the late Silurian.	
403	LITHOBIOMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		CHILOPODA	LITHOBIOMORPHA			Robust, flat. Inhabit enclosed spaces among stones, in soil, under bark. Lithobius.	
404	GEOPHILOMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		CHILOPODA	GEOPHILOMORPHA			Long, threadlike, adapted for living in soil. Have 27 to 191 pairs of legs, the most of any centipede. Blind. Unlike other centipedes, all tergites are the same length rather than alter- nately long and short. Dicellophilus, Stigmatogaster.	
405	SCOLOPENDROMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		CHILOPODA	SCOLOPENDROMORPHA			Large, heavy-bodied, flattened. In crevices, beneath stones, under bark and logs, insoil. Otocryptops, Scolopendra.	
406	CRATEROSTIGMOMORPHA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		CHILOPODA	CRATEROSTIGMOMORPHA			One described species, Craterostigmus tasmanianus, from Tasmania, and an undescribed species from New Zealand. Have 21 tergites and 15 pairs of legs.	
407	SYMPHYLA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		SYMPHYLA				Symphyla is a small taxon of approximately 160 described species of moist soil and leaf litter found in most parts of the world. Their permeable cuticle restricts them to humid habitats.	
408	DIPLOPODA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		DIPLOPODA				Diplopods are commonly known as millipedes, a name that implies possession of 1000 legs, although no known species has more than 710 and most have far fewer. Even so, millipedes have the most legs of any terrestrial animal. Diplopods are secretive, nocturnal detritivores that subsist on decaying vegetation. Negatively phototactic, they avoid light and live beneath leaves, stones, bark, and logs. Millipedes are common in soil and leaf litter and many are cave dwellers. They vary from 2 mm to almost 30 cm in length. Estimated to contain about 10,000 extant described species, Diplopoda is the largest myriapod taxon, and specialists estimate there could be as many as 80,000 species alive today, 70,000 of them as yet unknown. Their distribution is cosmopolitan, but they are especially abundant in the tropics.	
409	PENICILLATA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		DIPLOPODA	PENICILLATA			Very small (< 4 mm), distinctly bristly due to unique lateral and posterior tufts of serrate setae. The most primitive millipedes and those most like the diplopod ground plan. Cuticle is uncalcified, soft, flexible, unlike that of all other millipedes. Trichobothria are present on the head (but absent in all other diplopods, although present in symphylans and pauropods). Repugnatorial glands, which are present in at least some members of all other higher diplopod taxa, are absent. Sperm transfer is indirect, with spermatophores left on a silk web. Polyxenus.	
410	PENTAZONIA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA			PENTAZONIA			Unlike other millipedes; superficially look more like crustacean pill bugs, or wood lice. Legs are inconspicuous. Body is short, strongly convex dorsally. Capable of rolling the body into a sphere (like pill bugs), with vulnerable ventral parts tucked inside and protected by the heavily sclerotized tergites on the outside. The resulting ball is invulnerable to most would-be predators. Last pair of male legs with enlarged telopods is used to hold the female’s vulva during sperm transfer. Glomeris.	
411	COLOBOGNATHA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		DIPLOPODA	COLOBOGNATHA			Slow-moving colobognaths are even more wormlike than the juliforms, although at 3 to 50 mm long they are usually much smaller. Body is arched dorsally. Legs are so small that they can be mistaken for worms. Pointed head is narrower than body. Mouth parts are reduced, mandibles are stylets used for piercing and sucking. Food is assumed to be decayed and partially liquefied vegetation. Females and occasionally males protect the eggs by curling around them. Polyzonium.	
412	NEMATOPHORA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		DIPLOPODA	NEMATOPHORA			Body is cylindrical, may appear flattened if paranota are well developed. Three setae on the dorsal posterior margin of the telson ring are spinnerets. Have a mandibular molar with a strong posterior cusp, unknown in other millipedes. Chordeuma.	
413	MEROCHAETA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		DIPLOPODA	MEROCHAETA			Common, widespread. Large lateral paranota create a depressed appearance. Three to 130 mm long. Most have 20 diplo segments. Apheloria, Polydesmus, Sigmoria.	
414	JULIFORMIA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		DIPLOPODA	JULIFORMIA			The most common, familiar millipedes. Cylindrical, smooth, shiny, often large, with elongate, wormlike bodies. The largest millipedes, with some reaching 30 cm in length. To facilitate movement through the substratum, the collum is enlarged and covers part of the head capsule and anterior trunk. Repugnatorial secretions contain benzoquinones that are unique in millipedes but common in other arthropods. Cylindroiulus, Narceus.	
415	PAUROPODA	ARTHROPODA	MYRIAPODA		MYRIAPODA		PAUROPODA				Pauropoda is a small taxon of soft-bodied, nocturnal animals. These poorly known arthropods are widely distributed in both temperate and tropical regions in leaf litter, soil, damp wood, and under stones. All are minute, ranging from 0.5 to 1.9 mm in length. Although once considered rare, pauropods have now been found to be abundant in forest litter and approximately 500 species are known. The small number of known species is due to the small number of taxonomists who study them.	
416	ENTOGNATHA	ARTHROPODA	HEXAPODA		ENTOGNATHA						Apterygote. Mouthparts sunk into a depression on the surface of the head (entognathous). Poorly equipped for dry habitats; most are obligatory inhabitants of moist environments. Ametabolous.

Adults are predaceous; live in vegetation. Larvae are predaceous; most are terrestrial, living under the bark of conifers. Raphidia.	
458	HYMENOPTERA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		HYMENOPTERA						Large and varied taxon. All have chewing mouthparts, but they are modified for sucking in many taxa. Two pairs of membranous, transparent wings are present in most, but absent in some important exceptions, such as worker ants. First abdominal segment usually is broadly joined to the thorax and separated from the remaining abdomen by a narrow petiole, or waist, creating a secondary tagmosis. In females the ovipositor may be a sting. Larvae are maggotlike, with chewing mouthparts. Most adults feed on fluids such as nectar and honeydew and are found near flowers, where they may be important pollinators. Apanteles, Aphidius, Apis, Bombus, Eciton, Solenopsis, Vespa, Vespula, Xylocopa.	
459	TRICHOPTERA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		TRICHOPTERA						Adult is mothlike. Have two pairs of hairy wings. Poorly developed mouth parts. Adults either do not feed or subsist on a liquid diet of water and nectar and are relatively short-lived. Like those of mayflies and stoneflies, caddisfly larvae are aquatic microhabitat specialists often present in great diversity in suitable habits. Species diversity is greatest in cool, swift mountain streams. Larval life revolves around the use of silk for construction of cases and portable retreats of stones and vegetation, as anchor lines, and as filters for suspension feeding. Beraea, Helicopsyche, Hydropsyche, Polycentropus, Sericostoma.	
460	LEPIDOPTERA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		LEPIDOPTERA						Adult is soft-bodied. Wings, body, and appendages are covered with deciduous pigmented scales or hairlike setae. Mandibles are absent, maxillae form a coiled extensible proboscis for sucking nectar and fruitjuices; some species do not feed as adults. Larvae are herbivorous caterpillars. Salivary glands produce silk, the uses of which include construction of a cocoon in which the last larval instar pupates. Actias, Danaus, Heliconius, Heliothis, Lymantria, Manduca, Melittia, Papilio, Sibine.	
461	MECOPTERA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		MECOPTERA						Mouth parts are extended into aprominent ventral beak. Most have large, membranous wings. Adults are omnivorous; grub like larvae feed on organic matter. Bittacus, Boreus, Panorpa.	
462	SIPHONAPTERA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		SIPHONAPTERA						Small, secondarily wingless pterygotes with heavily sclerified, strongly compressed bodies. Bird and mammal ectoparasites. Legs adapted for jumping. Hematophagous, with piercing and sucking mouth parts. Some are vectors of bubonic plague (Xenopsylla) and typhus (Nosopsyllus). Mating takes place on the host or in its nest and eggs fall into the nest, where they hatch. Larvae feed on organic matter in the nest and are not parasitic. Eventually the larvae pupate and emerge as adults, which then infest the host. Ctenocephalides, Orchopeas, Pulex.	
463	STREPSIPTERA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		STREPSIPTERA						These tiny, bizarre insects are, as females and larvae, parasites on a variety of other insects. Females usually are larva-like, wingless, and never leave the host. They live embedded in the host’s integument, with only their anterior end, with spiracles, protruding as a low bump above the host’s exoskeleton. Nutriment from the host’s blood is absorbed directly across the permeable cuticle of the parasite’s embedded abdomen. In contrast, males have large, unusual, fanlike hind wings. The forewings are reduced to club-shaped, haltere-like appendages that may have a role in balance, and the hind wings are large. Adult males are short-lived, nonparasitic, and do not feed. Male’s com- pound eyes are large, protruding. Antennae typically have processes extending from the flagellum. Eoxenos, Halictophagus, Stylops, Triozocera.	
464	DIPTERA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA		DIPTERA						Large taxon including mosquitoes, horseflies, houseflies, blowflies, botflies, midges, gnats, craneflies, blackflies, and many others. Compound eyes are large, well developed. Functional, membranous forewings; reduced, knoblike hind wings (halteres). Mouthparts are variable, but basically are suctorial or sponging; used in conjunction with a cibarial pump. Almost all adult flies feed on plant or animal fluids. In many taxa known collectively as biting flies, females suck blood from vertebrate hosts, usually birds or mammals. Adults so frequently are vectors of human and animal diseases that this is the most important hexapod order in terms of human health. Larvae are maggots and are always found in wet substrata such as flesh, fruit, water, or mud. Females typically oviposit in a suitable moist food source for the larvae, which then live in their food as they consume it. Aedes, Aphidolestes, Callitroga, Chaoborus, Dermatobia, Eristalis, Gasterophilus, Musca, Psychoda, Tabanus.	
465	GASTROTRICHA 	CYCLONEURALIA	GASTROTRICHA 								Gastrotricha is a small but diverse taxon of some 500 species in 50 genera. These tiny metazoans inhabit interstitial spaces of marine and freshwater sediments, superficial detritus, the surfaces of submerged plants and animals, and the water film covering soil particles in terrestrial habitats. Gastrotrichs are common animals of ponds, streams, and lakes. The intertidal zone of a marine beach may harbor 40 or more species living in the spaces between sand grains, and as many as 1000 individuals have been reported from 20 ml of sand. Gastrotricha is divided into the marine Macrodasyida and the marine and freshwater Chaetonotida.	
466	ADENOPHOREA	CYCLONEURALIA	GASTROTRICHA 		ADENOPHOREA						Body usually is wormlike, elongate, dorsoventrally flattened. Adhesive tubes located at anterior and posterior ends and along the sides of body. Pharyngeal lumen is inverted Y shape; pharyngealpo respresent. Cellularepidermis. Hermaphroditic. In marine and estuarine sediments. Dactylopodola, Macrodasys, Pseudostomella, Tetranchyroderma, Turbanella, Urodasys.	
467	CHAETONOTIDA	CYCLONEURALIA	GASTROTRICHA 		CHAETONOTIDA						Body is bowling-pin-shaped. Adhesive tubes are restricted to posterior end. Pharyngeal lumen is Y-shaped; pharyngeal pores are absent. Syncytial epidermis. Freshwater and marine. Freshwater species are parthenogenetic. The primitive marine Neodasys, with a wormlike body, lateral and posterior adhesive tubules, and a cellular epidermis, is exceptional. Chaetonotus, Halichaetonotus, Lepidodermella, Neodasys, Xenotrichula.	
468	NEMATODA	CYCLONEURALIA	NEMATODA								Nematodes, or roundworms, are the most diverse cycloneuralian taxon and possibly the largest animal phylum. At present only about 20,000 species have been described, but there is speculation that millions more await discovery. Nematodes are among the most widespread and abundant of all metazoans. These worms inhabit moist interstitial environments in all habitats, including the bodies of plants and animals. They are abundant in marine and freshwater benthic habitats, in the soil, and as parasites in a great variety of plant and animal hosts. They occur from the poles to the tropics in all types of environments, including deserts, high mountains, and the deep sea. Nonparasitic nematodes are meiofaunal animals that live in the interstitial spaces of algal mats, aquatic sediments, and terrestrial soils, where they may be present in staggering numbers. One square meter of mud off the Dutch coast contains 4,420,000 nematodes, a hectare of good farm soil can contain billions of terrestrial nematodes, and a single decomposing apple lying on the ground in an orchard yielded 90,000 roundworms in several species.	
469	ADENOPHOREA	CYCLONEURALIA	NEMATODA		ADENOPHOREA						Polyphyletic. Most are free-living; some are parasitic. Free-living species include some terrestrial and almost all freshwater and marine nematodes. Variously shaped amphids located behind lips. Lack phasmids. Epidermal cells are uninucleate. Excretory glands are present. No excretory canals. Some taxa, with some representative genera, are Chromadorida (Chromadora, Stilbonema, Desmodora, Epsilonema), Desmodorida (Draconema), Desmoscolecida (Desmoscolex, Greejfiella), Dorylaimida (Dorylaimus), Enoplida (Oncholaimus), Meimithida (Mermis), Mononchida (Mononchus), Monhysterida (Monhystera, Gammarinema), Trefusiida (Onchulus, Kinonchulus, Trefusia), Trichocephalida (Trichinella, Trichuris).	
470	SECERNENTEA	CYCLONEURALIA	NEMATODA		SECERNENTEA						Almost all are terrestrial. Many are important parasites. Most free-living species live in soil. Amphids are porelike, located on lateral lips. Phasmids are present. Epidermal cells are uni or nmidnucleated. Excretory glands and/or excretory canals are present. Includes Ascaridida (Ascaris, Enterobius, Toxocara, Pcimscaris), Camallanida (Dracunculus), Diplogasterida (Odontopharynx), Rhabdidda (Ccienorhabditis, Rhabditis, Strongyloides, Turbatrix), Spirurida (Wuchereria, Spirura, Loa, Dirofilaria), Strongylida (Strongylus, Ancylostoma, Necator, Nippostrongylus), Tylenchida (Tylenchulus, Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Globodera).	
471	NEMATOMORPHA	CYCLONEURALIA	NEMATOMORPHA								Superficially resembling Nematoda is Nematomorpha, a small taxon of astonishingly long, but very slender cycloneuralians known as horsehair worms or hairworms. The adults are free- living and short-lived, whereas the parasitic larvae are the dominant stage of the life cycle. About 320 of the 325 nematomorph species belong to the taxon Gordioida and live as adults in fresh water and damp soil.	
472	NECTONEMATOIDA	CYCLONEURALIA	NEMATOMORPHA		NECTONEMATOIDA						Pelagic, marine. One genus, Nectonema, with four species. Body is 20 cm long. Have dorsal and ventral swimming setae, internal dorsal and ventral epidermal cords, fluid-filled hemocoel. Larvae and juveniles parasitize decapod crustaceans.	
473	GORDIOIDA	CYCLONEURALIA	NEMATOMORPHA		GORDIOIDA						Includes almost all nematomorphs. Adults are freshwater or semiterrestrial in damp soil.Juveniles mostly parasitize insects. Hemocoel is mostly filled with connective tissue. Only the ventral epidermal cord is present. Chordodes, Gordius, Parachordodes, Paragordius.	
474	PRIAPULIDA	CYCLONEURALIA	PRIAPULIDA								Priapulida consists of only 18 living species of marine worms. Priapulids are benthic and live in sand or mud bottoms in shallow and deep water. Most of the large-bodied species live in cold water, often at high latitudes, including the Arctic Ocean and the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica. Some families show a distinctly bipolar distribution, being absent from low latitudes. On North American coasts they occur northward from Massachusetts and central California. Some small priapulids, such as Tubiluchus, are more widely distributed, with ranges including the tropics. Priapulids were important members of the marine benthos in the middle Cambrian period and, although only 11 fossil species have been described, they were among the dominant invertebrates of Cambrian seas. The ecological importance of the taxon has declined precipitously, but modern species have changed little from their Cambrian ancestors. Priapulida is named for Priapus, the Greek god of male fertility.	
475	PRIAPULOMORPHA	CYCLONEURALIA	PRIAPULIDA		PRIAPULOMORPHA						Macrobenthic or meiobenthic. With caudal appendages. External or internal fertilization.	
476	PRIAPULIDAE	CYCLONEURALIA	PRIAPULIDA		PRIAPULIDAE						Large, macrobenthic. One or two caudal appendages. No polythyridium. No sexual dimorphism. Fertilization is external. Sperma reprimitive. Acanthopriapulus, Priapulopsis,Priapulus.	
477	TUBILUCHIDAE	CYCLONEURALIA	PRIAPULIDA		TUBILUCHIDAE						Small, meiobenthic, interstitial. One elongate caudal appendage. Trunk has tubuli. Distinct neck connects trunk and introvert.

482	CHAETOSTEPHANIDAE	CYCLONEURALIA	PRIAPULIDA		CHAETOSTEPHANIDAE						Maccabeus.	
483	LORICIFERA	CYCLONEURALIA	LORICIFERA								Loricifera is a small taxon of minuscule (< 0.5 mm) interstitial, marine animals related to priapulids and kinorhynchs and sharing many apomorphies with them. They are about the size of large ciliate protozoans but are multicellular, being composed of up to 10,000 tiny cells. Loriciferans adhere tenaciously to the substratum and consequently eluded discovery until 1983, when the first species, Nanaloricus mysticus, was described by the Danish zoologist R. M. Kristensen. Since then almost 100 additional species have been discovered, although most have not yet been described. They are widely distributed on a variety of sediment types over a wide range of depths and from the polar regions to the tropics.	
484	PLICILORICIDAE	CYCLONEURALIA	LORICIFERA		PLICILORICIDAE						Lorica is lightly sclerotized, with 22 or more plates and no anterior marginal spines. Foregut is simple. No sexual dimorphism. Anus and gonopore usually are ventroterminal. Toes are adhesive. Pliciloricus, Rugiloricus.	
485	NANALORICIDAE	CYCLONEURALIA	LORICIFERA		NANALORICIDAE						Lorica is heavily sclerotized, with 6 plates and 15 hollow anterior marginal spines. Foregut is complex. Sexes are dimorphic. Anus and gonopore are dorsoterminal. Toes are paddles. Nanaloricus.	
486	KINORHYNCHA	CYCLONEURALIA	KINORHYNCHA								Kinorhyncha (mud dragons) consists of about 150 described species of small marine metazoans that burrow in the surface layer of mud or live in the interstitial spaces of sand. They have been found from the intertidal zone to depths of several thousand meters and usually are less than 1mm in length. The short body is flattened ventrally, like that of gastrotrichs, but kinorhynchs lack locomotory cilia and, except for the absence of paired appendages, superficially resemble interstitial harpacticoid copepods, with which they are sometimes confused.	
487	CYCLORHAGIDA	CYCLONEURALIA	KINORHYNCHA		CYCLORHAGIDA						The most widely distributed and diverse kinorhynch taxon. Most have 14 to 16 placids in the neck region. Trunk is spiny and circular to triangular in cross section. Common in marine muds and subtidal sands. Ccimpyloderes, Catena, Centroderes, Condyloderes, Echinoderes, Semnoderes, Sphenoderes.	
488	HOMALORHAGIDA	CYCLONEURALIA	KINORHYNCHA		HOMALORHAGIDA						Relatively large (up to 1mm). Have six to eight placids in the neck region. Trunk has few spines. Distinctly triangular in cross section. Common in marine muds. Kinorhynchus, Neocentrophyes, Paracentrophyes, Pycnophyes.	
489	GNATHOSTOMULIDA	GNATHIFERA	GNATHOSTOMULIDA								Gnathostomulida is a small taxon of minute worms that live in the interstitial spaces of fine marines ands, especially those with little or no oxygen and a high concentration of hydrogen sulfide. Gnathostomulida was discovered in 1956, and since then more than 80 species in 18 genera have been found worldwide, especially along the east coast of North America.	
490	FILOSPERMOIDEA	GNATHIFERA	GNATHOSTOMULIDA		FILOSPERMOIDEA						Long, slender, up to 3.5 mm in length with relatively simple, compact jaws and filiform sperm. Anterior end is along, tactilerostrum with abundant sensory receptors. Two families. Haplognathia, Pterognathia.	
491	BURSOVAGINDIDEA	GNATHIFERA	GNATHOSTOMULIDA		BURSOVAGINDIDEA						Most gnathostomulans belong to this taxon. Body is relatively short, up to 1.5 mm long, 50 pm wide. Anterior end is not elongated to form a rostrum, but has sensory receptors. Elaborate, baskettype jaws. Sperm are spherical or pyriform rather than filiform, lack flagella and centrioles. Female system includes a seminal receptacle; penis has a stylet. Seven families in two orders. Austrognathia, Gnathostomaria, Gnathostomula, Labidognathia, Mesognatharia, Paragnathiella, Problognathia, Rastrognathia.	
492	MICROGNATHOZOA	GNATHIFERA	MICROGNATHOZOA								In 2000, R. M. Kristensen and P. Funch described Micrognathozoa as a new class from moss pillows in a cold, freshwater spring on Disko Island, Greenland, at 70° N latitude. The authors did not assign the new taxon to a phylum, although they did place it in Gnathifera. Micrognathozoais of particular interest because the structure of its pharyngeal jaw apparatus is similar to that of both gnathostomulans and monogonont rotifers and supports the hypothesis that these taxa are related. At present there is only one known species, Limnognathia maerski, which is epiphytic on mosses.	
493	SYNDERMATA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA								Three taxa formerly included in the large, probably polyphyletic Aschelminthes are now placed in Gnathifera. Rotifera, Seisonida, and Acanthocephala, although superficially dissimilar, have significant morphological and molecular features in common and are believed to constitute a monophyledc taxon usually referred to as Syndermata. Syndermata is characterized by a syncytial epidermis that contains within its cytoplasm a skeleton known as the intrasyncytial lamina. This skeleton is not molted. This is in sharp contrast to the extracellular, secreted cuticle of Arthropoda and Cycloneuralia. Further, the anterior end of the body can be retracted into the trunk, an action that requires the presence of a fluid-filled hemocoel to receive the head.	
494	ROTIFERA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA								Rotifera contains the microscopic metazoans known as rotifers, or wheel animalcules. Rotifers are common in freshwater habitats, such as lakes and streams, and in terrestrial habitats, such as the film of water covering mosses and soil particles. Some are found in the sea. Although most rotifers are benthic, the relatively few planktonic species are so abundant that they are one of the three most important metazoan taxa in freshwater zooplankton communities. Although only about 50 rotifer species occur exclusively in marine waters, some, such as Synchaeta, are disproportionately important in nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems. In freshwater systems, rotifers typically reach densities of between 200 and 1000 individuals per liter, sometimes much more. Soilrotifers may achieve densities as high a s2million/m and play an important role in nutrient cycling. Almost 2000 species have been described, and most have widespread distributions.	
495	MONOGONONTA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		MONOGONONTA					Taxon of about 1600 species in 95 genera includes most rotifers. Reproduction is chiefly by parthenogenesis but sometimes is bisexual with dwarf, non feeding males. Have one germovitellarium, heterogonous life cycles. Gametes are produced by mitosis or meiosis. Stomach is cellular. Most are benthic, either free-living or attached, but approximately 100 fresh water species are planktonic.	
496	PLOIMA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		PLOIMA					Large taxon of 17 families contains the majority of rotifer species. Aquatic; benthic and planktonic (many). Lorica is present or absent, sometimes short or saclike. Usually have two toes. Corona lacks buccal field; circumapical band is not delimited by a trochus and cingulum. Important families include Asplanchnidae, Brachionidae, Synchaetidae, Notommatidae, and Trichoceridae, and genera include Albertia, Asplanchna, Brachionus, Chromogaster, Dicranophorus, Drilophaga, Euchlanis, Gastropus, Keratella, Notommata, Polyartkra, Proales, Synchaeta.	
497	FLOSCULARIACEA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		FLOSCULARIACEA					Some are sessile with secreted tubes; others are planktonic and free swimming. Many important planktonic rotifers belong to this order. Usually are toeless. Corona has a trochus and cingulum; mastax is malleoramate. The six families include Flosculariidae, Hexarthridae, Conochilidae, Testudinellidae. Conochilus, Floscularia, Hexarthra, Testudinella, Trochosphaera.	
498	COLLOTHECACEA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		COLLOTHECACEA					Most are sessile. Mouth is at the bottom of a shallow, flaring, anterior concavity. Anterior end often surrounded by arms with bundles of extensible bristles. Some taxa have a corona. Foot is enclosed in gelatinous envelope. Mastax is reduced, uncinate. Pedal glands are present, but toes are lacking. Collothecidae. Acyclus, Collotheca, Cupelopagis, Stephanoceros.	
499	BDELLOIDEA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		BDELLOIDEA					Paired germovitellaria; males are absent; reproduction is always parthenogenetic. Benthic or terrestrial; about 350 species in 18 genera. Some inhabit the film of capillary water covering soil particles and mosses. Anterior end is retractile; usually have two trochal discs and a cingulum. Mastax is adapted for grinding with flattened uncini and a reduced fulcrum. Stomach is syncytial. Have two germo vitellaria. Telescoping cylindrical body usually has 16 rings. Includes swimming and creeping species. Males are absent. Gametes (amictic eggs) are diploid, produced mitotically. Contains four families, including Philodinidae and Habrotrochidae. Adineta, Embata, Henoceros, Philodina, Rotaria, Zelinkiella.	
500	SEISONIDA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		SEISONIDA					Seisonida contains only two species, which are sometimes considered to be rotifers. Both species are ectoparasites on the carapace of the primitive malacostracan crustacean Nebalia, They feed on debris and the eggs of the host. Both belong to the genus Seison and, although they share many characteristics with rotifers, there are important differences. Seisonids, at about 3 mm, are very large in comparison with rotifers, which are usually less then 0.5 mm. The corona is reduced to a few clusters of bristles and, unlike that of rotifers, does not function in feeding or locomotion. The mastax is aberrant and difficult to compare with those of rotifers. It is fulcrate, a type unique to seisonids, and its trophi are difficult to homologize with those of rotifers. It apparently consists of a large fulcrum, two manubria, and several small trophi.	
501	ACANTHOCEPHALA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		ACANTHOCEPHALA					Acanthocephala (spinyheaded worms) is a taxon of some 1150 species of derived, relatively large, parasitic, wormlike gnathiferans. The body cavity is a spacious hemocoel, there is no gut, and many tissues are syncytial and eutelic. Food is absorbed across the epidermis and distributed by a unique intraepidermal lacunar system. All are endoparasites and require two hosts to complete the life cycle. The larvae are parasitic in arthropods and the adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates, especially fishes. The cylindrical adult body is elongate and composed of a trunk and a short, anterior, spiny, retractable proboscis (introvert) joined to the trunk by a neck.	
502	ARCHIACANTHOCEPHALA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		ARCHIACANTHOCEPHALA					Bird and mammal parasites; intermediate hosts are centipedes, millipedes, insects. Main lacunar canals are dorsal and ventral. Two ligament sacs, which break down in reproductive females. Protonephridia present in one family. Macracanthorhynchus, Mediorhynchus, Moniliformis, Oligacanthorhynchus, Prosthenorchis.	
503	EOACANTHOCEPHALA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		EOACANTHOCEPHALA					Parasites of fishes, amphibians, reptiles; crustaceans are intermediate hosts. Main lacunar canals are dorsal and ventral. Two ligament sacs, which persist in reproductive females. Neoechinorhynchus.	
504	PALAECANTHOCEPHALA	GNATHIFERA	SYNDERMATA	ROTIFERA		PALAECANTHOCEPHALA					The largest, most diverse taxon.Parasites of all vertebrate classes; intermediate hosts usually are crustaceans. Main lacunar canals are lateral. One ligament sac, which breaks down in reproductive females. Acanthocephalus, Echinorhynchus, Leptorhynchoides, Polymorphous.	
505	LOXOSOMATIDAE	KAMPTOZOA	LOXOSOMATIDAE								Most are commensal with marine invertebrates. Anus is elevated above the floor of the atrium by a tall anal cone. Protonephridia with separate nephridiopores are present. Loxomespilon, Loxosoma, Loxosomella.	
506	LOXOKALYPODIDAE	KAMPTOZOA	LOXOSOMATIDAE								Monotypic family. Solitary. Musculature extends uninterrupted between the calyx and stalk. Star cell complex and septum are absent. Loxokalypus.	
507	PEDICELLINIDAE	KAMPTOZOA	LOXOSOMATIDAE								No anal cone; anus and mouth are on the floor of the atrium. Blood is circulated by contractile cells. Protonephridia share a common nephridiopore. Unsegmented stalk and its longitudinal muscles are continuous. Larvae undergo a complex metamorphosis after settling. Myosoma, Pedicellina, Pedicellinopsis, Sangavella.	
508	BARENTSIIDAE	KAMPTOZOA	LOXOSOMATIDAE								Anal cone is lacking. Blood is circulated by contractile cells. Protonephridia have a common nephridiopore. Stalk is divided into segments. Proximal and distal segments are muscular, but intervening segments lack muscles. Ascopodaria, Barentsia, Urnatella.	
509	PHORONIDA	LOPHOPHORATA	PHORONIDA								Phoronida consists of only two genera, Phoronis and Phoronopsis, and 14 species of wormlike, sessile, benthic animals found only in the sea. Externally they are bilaterally symmetrical, but internally they are asymmetrical with left-side dominance. Phoronids live in secreted chitinous tubes buried in sand or attached to rocks, shells, and other objects in shallow water. Some have bright green lophophores. A few species, such as the primitive Phoronis ovalis, bore into mollusc shells or calcareous rock. Phoronis vancouverensis along the Pacific coast of North America often forms masses of intertwined individuals. Phoronids are 2 to 20 cm in length but only 1 to 2 mm in diameter, making them exceedingly slender. Most are found in the relatively shallow water of the continental shelves.	
510	PHORONIS	LOPHOPHORATA	PHORONIDA		PHORONIS						The body has two sections, each with its own coelom. There is a specialist feeding structure, the lophophore, which is an extension of the wall of the coelom and is surrounded by tentacles. Actinotrocha.	
511	PHORONOPSIS	LOPHOPHORATA	PHORONIDA		PHORONOPSIS						Like other phoronids, members of this genus are benthic filter feeders with a worm-like body encased in a loosely fitting chitinous tube. The tube is buried in the substrate, and the worm is anchored to the tube by an ampulla, the swollen part of its abdomen.	
512	BRACHIOPODA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA								Brachiopods are commonly known as lamp shells because their shells sometimes resemble ancient Roman oil lamps. More importantly, these animals also resemble bivalve molluscs in being suspension feeders with a mantle, mantle cavity, and bivalved calcareous shell. In fact, until the middle of the 19th century they were thought to be molluscs. The resemblance to clams, though striking, is superficial, and brachiopods are now placed in their own taxon far removed from Mollusca. In both taxa, two mineralized valves enclose a soft body, but in brachiopods the valves are dorsal and ventral where as in bivalve molluscs they are right and left.	
513	INARTICULATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA		INARTICULATA						Possibly not monophyletic. Hinge is simple; valves are held together only by muscles and connective tissue; no hinge teeth or sockets. Valves are closed by direct muscular action, opened by hydrostatic coelomic pressure. Valve musculature is complex. Gut is complete, U-shaped, includes an anus. No brachidia from the dorsal valve support the lophophore. development is direct; larva resembles a tiny adult, with a bivalve mantle and body lobe.	
514	LINGULIDA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA		LINGULIDA						Burrow in soft sediments. Have hemerythrin as respiratory pigment. Most have a chitinophosphate shell; the periostracum has chitin. Anus is on the right. Lingula, Glottidia.	
515	DISCINIDA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA		DISCINIDA						Attach to hard surfaces with a short pedicle. Discina, Discinisca.	
516	CRANIIDA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA		CRANIIDA						Pedicle is absent; ventral valve attaches directly to the hard substratum. Shell is calcareous; periostracum contains chitin. Anus is on posterior mid line. Crania, Neocrania.	
517	ARTICULATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA		ARTICULATA						Complex hinge with interlocking teeth and sockets. Calcite (calcium carbonate) shell. Periostracum lacks chitin. Dorsal valve usually has calcareous brachidia to support the lophophore. Shell is opened and closed by direct action of the adductor and abductor muscles. The pedicle, when present, is supported by connective tissue. Gut ends blindly; anus is absent. Larva has three body regions: body, mantle, and pedicle lobes. Most attach to hard substrates but some (such as Chlidonophora) anchor in soft sediments with a branching root like pedicle.	
518	TEREBRATULIDA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA		TEREBRATULIDA						The most abundant Recent brachiopods. Brachidium is a complex loop. Argyrotheca, Calloria, Chlidonophora, Gryphus, Gwynia, Lacazella, Liothyrella, Megathyris, Neothyris, Pajaudina, Terebratalia, Terebratella, Terebratula, Terebratulina, Thecidellina.	
519	RHYNCHONELLIDA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRACHIOPODA		RHYNCHONELLIDA						Brachidia are simple, a strongly convex shell, and two pairs of metanephridia. Hemithyris, Notosaria.	
520	BRYOZOA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA								Bryozoa (= Ectoprocta, Polyzoa, “moss animals”), with approximately 5000 living species, is the largest, best known, and most widespread of the lophophorate taxa. Bryozoans are benthic and colonial, with most species living attached to firm substrata, but one genus is solitary and a few form motile colonies. The colonies, which do not look much like animals, may be large, but each is composed of numerous tiny zooids that are unmistakably animal-like.	
521	PHYLACTOLAEMATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		PHYLACTOLAEMATA						Exclusively in fresh water. Widely distributed in lakes, reservoirs, and streams without excessive mud or silt. Many species (such as Fredericella sultana and Plumatella repens) are cosmopolitan. Zooids are cylindrical, the lophophore is horseshoe-shaped (except Fredericella). An epistome is present.	
522	GYMNOLAEMATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		GYMNOLAEMATA						Colonies are polymorphic. Zooids are cylindrical or flattened. Body wall may be calcified or not. Lophophore is circular. Epistome is absent. Intrinsic body-wall musculature is absent. Almost entirely marine.	
523	CLYCLOSTOMATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		CLYCLOSTOMATA						Entirely marine. Mesothelium separated from body wall to form a membranous coelomic sac. Large, spacious hemocoel is continuous with that of adjacent zooids. These are tubular zooids with calcified walls that are fused with those of adjacent zooids. Orifices are circular and terminal. Lophophore protrusion is dependent on muscular deformation of the membranous sac, not the body wall. Crisia, Lichenopora, Stomatopora, Tubulipora.	
524	EURYSTOMATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		EURYSTOMATA						Body wall lacks muscles. Lophophore protrusion depends on body-wall deformation. Interzooidal pores are plugged with cellular rosettes and have an associated funicular system.	
525	CTENOSTOMATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		CTENOSTOMATA						Stolonate or compact colonies. Zooecium is non calcified membranous, chitinous, or gelatinous. Orifice usually is terminal. No operculum is present.	
526	STOLONIFERA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		STOLONIFERA						Colonies consist of branching stolons with solitary or clustered vase-shaped zooids. Ancestrula develops stolons from which autozooids arise. Zooids bud from the stolon, not from each other. Amathia, Aeverrillia, Bowerbankia, Zoobotryon, Walkeria.	
527	CARNOSA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		CARNOSA						Ancestrula produces zooids, which then produce more zooids; zooids bud from other zooids, not from stolons. Zooids are flat, not circular, in cross section. Colonies may be compact or diffuse. Alcyonidium, Flustrellidra, Monobryozoon, Paludicella (freshwater).	
528	CHEILOSTOMATA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		CHEILOSTOMATA						Most recent bryozoans are cheilostomes. Colonies are composed of contiguous boxlike zooids with separate calcareous walls. Orifice has an operculum (lost in Bugula). Avicularia, vibracula, or both may be present. Eggs typically are brooded in ovicells.	
529	ANASCA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		ANASCA						Frontal (ventral) wall is membranous, flexible. Lophophore is protruded by parietal muscles acting on the frontal membrane. Aetea, Callopora, Electra, Flustra, Membranipora, Tendra, Bugula, Scrupocellaria, Cupuladria, Discoporella, Thalamoporella, Cellaria.	
530	CRIBRIMORPHA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		CRIBRIMORPHA						Almost extinct. Frontal wall is a vault of fused over arching spines, which form a porous calcified plate over the flexible frontal membrane. Lophophore is protruded by parietal muscles acting on the frontal membrane. Sometimes included in Anasca or Ascophora. Cribrilina.	
531	ASCOPHORA	LOPHOPHORATA	BRYOZOA		ASCOPHORA						Frontal wall is calcified, underlaid by a flexible invaginated sac, the ascus. Lophophore protrusion is achieved through dilation of the ascus by parietal muscles. Microporella, Schizoporella, Smittina, Watersipora.	
532	ELEUTHEROZOA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA								Eleutherozoans are the sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers. These echinoderms are all motile and primitively oriented with their oral surface against the substratum. The sister taxon of Eleutherozoa is Crinoidea, the sessile sea lilies.	
533	ASTERIODEA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		ASTERIODEA						The 1500 living species of asteroids are the sea stars, or starfishes. Their star-shaped, free-moving body consists of hollow arms, or rays, projecting from a central disc. Asteroids are common animals that crawl about over rocks and shells or live on sandy or muddy bottoms. They occur worldwide, largely in coastal waters, but the northeast Pacific Ocean, particularly from Puget Sound to the AJeutian Islands, has the greatest diversity of asteroids with over 70 species. Sea stars commonly are red, orange, blue, purple, or green or exhibit combinations of colors.	
534	PAXILLOSIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		ASTERIODEA		PAXILLOSIDA				Primitive asteroids that lack tube-foot suckers and anus, but have marginal plates and paxillae; have papulae on aboral surface. Intraoral feeders. On soft bottoms. Astropecten, Luidia, Platyasterias.	
535	VALVATIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		ASTERIODEA		VALVATIDA				Have suckered tube feet, few large marginal plates; some spp. have paxillae and sessile valvate (clam-like) pedicellariae. Often have rigid pentagonal bodies. Extraoral feeders. Acanthaster, Ctenodiscus, Culcita, Goniaster, Linckia, Oreaster, Porania, Xyloplax.	
536	VELATIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		ASTERIODEA		VELATIDA				Papulae are widely distributed on upper surface; have suckered tube feet and spiniform or sessile pedicellariae. Extraoral feeders. Crossaster, Pteraster, Solaster.	
537	SPINULOSIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		ASTERIODEA		SPINULOSIDA				Have suckered tube feet; aboral surface bears short spines; marginal plates and pedicellariae are absent. Extraoral feeders. Asterina, Dermasterias, Echinaster, Henricia, Patiria.	
538	FORCIPULATA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		ASTERIODEA		FORCIPULATA				Have suckered tube feet, usually four rows per arm; stalked pedicellariae with two jaws. Extraoral feeders. Asterias, Heliaster, Leptasterias, Pisaster, Pycnopodia, Zoroaster.	
539	BRISINGIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		ASTERIODEA		BRISINGIDA				Have more than five long, slender spinyarms; abundant pedicellariae with crossed jaws are used to catch suspended prey. Deepwater animals. Brisinga, Freyella, Midgardia.	
540	CRYPTOSYRINGIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA						The remaining eleutherozoans—brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers—are members of this taxon. They differ from asteroids in having internalized the ectoneural (sensory) components of the nerve ring and radial nerves. Instead of being located in the oral epidermis of the disc and arms, as in asteroids, these nerves now occur in the epithelial lining of an internal, hollow epineural canal (“Cryptosy- ringida” = hidden tube).	
541	OPHIUROIDEA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		OPHIUROIDEA				The 2000 species of snaky-armed ophiuroids are known as serpent stars or brittle stars, and those with branched arms are called basket stars. As the most diverse group of echinoderms, brittle stars are adapted to a wide variety of mostly cryptic lifestyles and for that reason usually are not conspicuous. Nevertheless, brittle stars are common in many benthic marine habitats and a search for them is rarely unfulfilled. Along with sea lilies and feather stars (Crinoidea), they are the most graceful, delicate, and striking echinoderms. Some species are covered with colorful, faceted crystalline spines and seem to be made of cut glass.	
542	OEGOPHIURIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		OPHIUROIDEA	OEGOPHIURIDA			Mostly extinct ophiuroids, with only one extant Indonesian species, Ophiocanops fugiens. Lacks genital bursae, oral and aboral arm plates; madreporite on disc margin, not oral.	
543	PHRYNOPHIUROIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		OPHIUROIDEA	PHRYNOPHIUROIDA			Have a fleshy integument, glandular mucus-secreting epidermis; often lack aboral arm shields; coil arms vertically. Basket stars (Gorgonocephalidae) and Ophiomyxidae: Asteronyx, Astrophyton, Gorgonocephalus, Ophiomyxa.	
544	OPHIURIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		OPHIUROIDEA	OPHIURIDA			Have a thin epidermis, well-developed dermal disc ossicles and arm shields; arms move horizontally. Includes most species of ophiuroids. Amphipholis, Amphiura, Hemiphalis, Ophiactis, Ophiocoma, Ophioderma, Ophiolepis, Ophionereis, Ophiothrix, Ophiura.	
545	ECHINOZOA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA				Echinozoa includes Echinoidea (urchins) and Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers). Both taxa lack arms, but the ambulacra and oral surface have expanded aborally to cover most of the body, except for an aboral anus and periproct, a small region around the anus. Primitively, the oral-aboral axis is elongate and the body is bulbous or cylindrical. The pharynx is surrounded by a calcareous ring of fused ossicles, and ossicles also occur in the tube feet. Unlike other echinoderms, echinozoans have a well-developed hemal system.	
546	ECHINOIDEA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA			The 950 species of echinoids are mobile echinoderms known as sea urchins, heart urchins, sea biscuits, and sand dollars. The conspicuous sea urchins graze on hard substrates and have been known since antiquity.	
547	CIDAROIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA	CIDAROIDA		Have simple (non compound) ambulacral plates, each with one pore pair; widely separated primary spines, small secondary spines; jaw muscles attached to interambulacral plate processes; gills and spheridia absent. 150 spp. Pencil urchins Cidaris, Eucidaris, Notocidaris.	
548	EUECHINOIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA	EUECHINOIDA		Ambulacral plates are compound, each formed of three or more primary plates with two or more pore pairs; jaw muscles attach to ambulacral plate processes. 800 spp.	
549	ECHINOTHUROIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA	ECHINOTHUROIDA		Mostly deep-water leather urchins with a flexible test and poison sacs near the spine tips. Asthenosoma.	
550	DIADEMATOIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA	DIADEMATOIDA		Regular urchins with a rigid or flexible test with hollow spines; have 10 oral plates on peristomial membrane. Diadema, Plesiodiadema.	
551	ECHINACEA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA	ECHINACEA		Regular urchins with a rigid test and solid spines. Gills are present. Arbacia, Echinometra, Echinostrephus, Echinus, Lytechinus, Paracentrotus, Psammechinus, Toxopneustes, Tripneustes, Strongylocentrotus. Slate pencil urchins Colobocentrotus, Heterocentrotus.	
552	CLYPEASTEROIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA	CLYPEASTEROIDA		Sea biscuits and sand dollars specialized to live on or just below sediment surface. Test is slightly depressed to flat; jaws and petaloid tube feet are present; anus is displaced posteriorly. Clypeaster, Dendraster, Encope, Fibularia, Mellita, Rotula.	
553	SPATANGOIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	ECHINOIDEA	SPATANGOIDA		Oval, elongate heart urchins. Mouth is shifted anteriorly, anus posteriorly. Jaws are absent. Echinocardium, Eovenia, Meoma, Moira, Spatangus.	
554	HOLOTHUROIDEA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	HOLOTHUROIDEA			The holothuroids, or holothurians, are the sea cucumbers, a taxon of only 1200 species that has radiated into a greater number of different habitats than any other group of echinoderms. Many cucumbers burrow, some crawl on sand, others occupy crevices, still others attach to hard surfaces, a few climb on algae, and a handful are pelagic. Burrowers and crevice dwellers may resemble a cucumber, banana, or worm; crawlers imitate a giant caterpillar, those on hard surfaces can mimic a chiton, and swimming species resemble a parasail or umbrella. Ranging in size from a few millimeters for the interstitial Leptosynapta minuta to 2m for the tropical Holothuria thomasi, most cucumbers are greater than 10cm in length and often have robust, meaty bodies. Approximately one-third of the species live in the deep sea (more than 60% of the Earth’s surface), where they can account for up to 90% of the benthic biomass.	
555	DACTYLOCHIROTIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	HOLOTHUROIDEA	DACTYLOCHIROTIDA		Have a U-shaped body enclosed in flexible test and simple, unbranched buccal podia. Echinocucumis, Sphaerothuria.	
556	DENDROCHIROTIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	HOLOTHUROIDEA	DENDROCHIROTIDA		Have a cucumber, banana, or U-shaped body; branched (dendritic) buccal podia lack ampullae; usually have a retractile introvert. Cucumaria, Psolus, Sclerodactyla, Thyone, Thyonella.	
557	ASPIDOCHIROTIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	HOLOTHUROIDEA	ASPIDOCHIROTIDA		Have bilateral symmetry, a creeping sole, and peltate (shield-shaped) buccal podia; deposit-feeders. Actinopyga, Holothuria, Isostichopus, Stichopus.	
558	ELASIPODIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	HOLOTHUROIDEA	ELASIPODIDA		Deepwater or pelagic with gelatinous bodies adapted for swimming. Have peltate buccal podia; lack respiratory trees; ossicles are reduced or absent. Enypniastes, Pelagothuria, Peniagone, Scotoplanes.	
559	APODIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	HOLOTHUROIDEA	APODIDA		Wormlike, small-bodied (except Euapta) animals with a thin body wall; buccal podia are pinnate or fingerlike; lack respiratory trees, radial canals, tube feet; anchor and anchor-plate ossicles function like Velcro hooks. Euapta, Labidoplax, Leptosynapta, Synapta, Synaptula.	
560	MOLPADIIDA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA		CRYPTOSYRINGIDA		ECHINOZOA	HOLOTHUROIDEA	MOLPADIIDA		Includes head-down mud burrowers with digitate buccal podia, respiratory trees, and radial canals, but tube feet are absent. Molpadia, Caudina.	
561	CRINOIDEA	ECHINODERMATA	CRINOIDEA								The 700 species of crinoids are represented by 100 species of sea lilies and 600 species of colorful feather stars. There are many more extinct species known only from fossils. All are radially symmetric, sessile or semisessile suspension feeders that, unlike other echinoderms, live with the mouth oriented upward.	
562	ISOCRINIDA	ECHINODERMATA	CRINOIDEA		ISOCRINIDA						Deepwater, stalked crinoids with evenly spaced whorls of five cirri each along the stalk; large crown has some 50 arms; can crawl over the bottom using cirri and crown arms. Diplocrinus, Metacrinus.	
563	MILLERICRINIDA	ECHINODERMATA	CRINOIDEA		MILLERICRINIDA						Deepwater animals with a stalk lacking cirri; have a long, conical crown with five arms. Hyocrinus.	
564	CYRTOCRINIDA	ECHINODERMATA	CRINOIDEA		CYRTOCRINIDA						Deepwater, small-bodied crinoids with a short, irregular stalk that lacks cirri; have 10 arms. Three species of Holopus.	
565	BOURGUETICRINIDA	ECHINODERMATA	CRINOIDEA		BOURGUETICRINIDA						Have a slender stalk that ends in an attachment base and lacks cirri. Conocrinus.	
566	COMATULIDA	ECHINODERMATA	CRINOIDEA		COMATULIDA						Ranges from shallow water to great depths. Stalk is present only in pentacrinoid stage, absent in adult, which has grasping cirri and can swim with the arms. Six hundred species of Antedon, Comactinia, and Florometra, among others.	
567	CEPHALOCHORDATA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA								The 30 described species of cephalochordates are glossy slivers that swim rapidly and slip through sand or fingers like tiny eels. Also known as lancelets, or amphioxus, these small, fish-like chordates occur in tropical and temperate oceans world- wide. Unlike most fish, however, lancelets burrow in porous intertidal or shallow subtidal sand and rarely emerge to swim in the water. While in their burrows, they expose the mouth to water at the sediment surface and filter out suspended food particles. Although widespread globally, their patchy local distributions are influenced by sediment suitability and the abundance of phytoplankton food. When these conditions are met, lancelet populations can be impressive. For example, Branchiosioma caribaeum occurs in densities of up to 5000 individuals per m2 of sand in Discovery Bay, Jamaica.	
568	TUNICATA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA						The sea squirts and their planktonic relatives, although clearly chordates, have diverged farthest from the chordate ground plan. Tunicates are common marine animals that little resemble other chordates, or other animals for that matter. Most are sessile, attached organisms with the body covered and attached to the substratum by a complex tunic.	
569	ASCIDIACEA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		ASCIDIACEA				Ascidians, often called sea squirts, are common sessile, marine invertebrates throughout the world. Species are either solitary or colonial, with few to thousands of tiny zooids per colony.	
570	ENTEROGONA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		ASCIDIACEA	ENTEROGONA			Gonads located in or beside gut loop; neural gland is below cerebral ganglion.	
571	APLONSOBRANCHIA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		ASCIDIACEA	APLONSOBRANCHIA			Colonial, primarily compound species. Epicardia and sometimes a post abdomen are present. Clavelina (light bulb tunicates) zooids are not compound, but inteijoined at bases.	
572	PHLEBOBRANCHIA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		ASCIDIACEA	PHLEBOBRANCHIA			Colonial or solitary, with or without an epicardium, lack a post abdomen. Lining of phlebobranch pharynx is either flat or undulating. Numerous raised papillae that protrude from the trans- verse pharyngeal vessels help to support the mucous feeding net and may improve water flow through it.	
573	PLEUROGONA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		ASCIDIACEA	PLEUROGONA			Gonad, or gonads, situated on inner surface of body wall. Epicardium is absent, except as a specialized renal sac in Molgulidae.	
574	STOLIDOBRANCHIA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		ASCIDIACEA	STOLIDOBRANCHIA			Solitary or colonial. Pharyngeal lining is highly pleated with both transverse and longitudinal vessels. Gill-slit number varies with body size. Molgulidae has renal sacs and numerous spiral gill slits.	
575	THALIACEA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		THALIACEA				The other two tunicate taxa, Thaliacea and Appendicularia, are both specialized for a free-swimming, planktonic existence. Thaliacean zooids, which include the luminescent pyrosomes, barrel-shaped doliolids, and chainlike salps, differ from most ascidians in having the buccal and atrial siphons at opposite ends of the body. The water current is thus used not only for feeding and gas exchange, but in most also forjet propulsion. Like many other planktonic animals, thaliaceans are transparent. The tunic, which may be thin or thick, and the connective tissue are gelatinous and buoyant. Like ascidians, thaliaceans are mucous-net filter feeders that remove large quantities of minute suspended material from sea water. They may occur in enormous numbers over large areas of the sea, but most species occur in warm water. The approximately 75 species of thaliaceans are divided into three taxa, Pyrosomida, Doliolida, and Salpida.	
576	PYROSOMIDA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		THALIACEA	PYROSOMIDA			The 10 species of tropical pyrosomes are brilliantly luminescent colonies in the form of a hollow tube closed at one end. The colony length ranges from a few centimeters (as in Pyrosoma atlanticum) to over 20 m (as in Pyrostremma spinosum). The zooids are embedded in the wall (common tunic)of the tube, similar to the zooids of a compound ascidian.	
577	DOLIOLIDA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		THALIACEA	DOLIOLIDA			The 23 species of doliolids have barrel-shaped zooids ranging in size from 1 to 50 mm. The body-wall muscles are eight or nine hooplike bands around the circumference of the body. Contraction of these cross-striated muscles results in ajet thrust from the atrial siphon. Backflow through the buccal siphon, at the opposite end of the body, is prevented by a one way valve. Although this muscular pumping is responsible for locomotion, the filter feeding current is generated by gill slit cilia, as it is in ascidians and pyrosomes.	
578	SALPIDA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		THALIACEA	SALPIDA			The 40-some species of salps have prism-shaped zooids with hooplike muscles, like doliolids, but some adjacent muscle bands are partly fused. The zooids range in size from a few millimeters to 4 cm (as in Salpafusiformis). The muscle bands of salps pump water forjet propulsion and, uniquely, also for biter feeding. The salp pharynx is peculiar in having only a single mid-dorsal gill bar and no side walls.	
579	APPENDICULARIA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA		TUNICATA		APPENDICULARIA				Most of the 70 species of Appendicularia are tiny filter-feeding tadpoles that abound in the surface and midwater plankton of the world’s oceans. Under ideal conditions, their numbers may be astronomical: 25,620 individuals of Oikopleura dioica percubic meter of water were reported from British Columbia. The name Appendicularia refers to their tail, which persists throughout the life of the animal. The alternative name, Larvacea, indicates their resemblance to the tadpole larva of ascidians. Appendicularians are the only tunicates to have all the key chordate characteristics as adults.
