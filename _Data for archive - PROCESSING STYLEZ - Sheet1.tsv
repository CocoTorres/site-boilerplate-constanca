001	EUGLENOIDEA	PROTOZOA	EUGLENOZOA	----------------------------	EUGLENOIDEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	The euglenoid species of Peranema and Euglena are among the most familiar of all flagellates. The body is elongate with an invagination, the reservoir, at the anterior end. The cytostome lies at the base of the reservoir and joins a cytopharynx. A contractile vacuole discharges into the reservoir in freshwater species, and two flagella, each bearing a row of mastigonemes, arise from the reservoir wall.         
002	KINETOPLASTIDA	PROTOZOA	EUGLENOZOA	----------------------------	KINETOPLASTIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Kinetoplastid flagellates are colorless heterotrophs. A few of the 600 species are free living, but most are important parasites. All share the flagellar paraxial rod with their euglenoid relatives, but uniquely have a conspicuous mass of DNA, called a kinetoplast, located within a single, large mitochondrion. Most of the kinetoplast DNA sequences code for the morphogenesis of mitochondria. The large kinetoplast genome probably is related to the cyclical differentiation and regression of mitochondria as parasitic kinetoplastids adapt their energy metabolism to alternating aerobic and anaerobic host environments. The one or two flagella arise from a reservoir-like pit, which bears a cytostome that leads into a cytopharynx. Their basal bodies are located on or near the kinetoplast mitochondrion. 
003	VOLVOCIDA	PROTOZOA	CHLOROPHYTA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	VOLVOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Volvocida is a taxon of green algae (Chlorophyta), in which the large, cup-shaped chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b and a pyrenoid that synthesizes starch (amylopectin) as a food storage product. Many chlorophytes are nonmotile marine and freshwater algae, such as the filamentous Spirogyra of fresh water. The cells of Volvocida, however, are permanently flagellated: Each cell bears two, four, or occasionally eight flagella lacking mastigonemes. An eyespot and two contractile vacuoles also may be present. The cells are enclosed in a gel matrix composed of glycoproteins and glycoaminoglycans and are inter joined by cytoplasmic bridges. 
004	CHOANOFLAGELLATA	PROTOZOA	CHOANOFLAGELLATA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	PHYLUM	Surprising as it may seem, the marine and freshwater choanoflagellates are the sister taxon of animals (Metazoa). Both choanoflagellate and primitive monociliated animal cells bear a single flagellum, which bears a bilateral vane of mastigoneme-like filaments and is surrounded by a cylindrical collar of microvilli. This synapomorphy, along with support provided by rDNA sequences, unites the choanoflagellates and metazoans as sister taxa in amonophyletic taxon. The 600 species of choanoflagellates are mostly tiny and inconspicuous, usually not in excess of 10pm in diameter. While feeding, the flagellum creates a water current from which the collar filters bacteria and organic particulates. Bacteria trapped on the collar are ingested by phagocytosis.
005	RETORTAMONADEA	PROTOZOA	RETORTAMONADA	----------------------------	RETORTAMONADEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Two or four anterior flagella, one of which is associated with the cytostome, which is elongate longitudinally as a body furrow; mitochondria are absent.

008	PARABASALEA	PROTOZOA	AXOSTYLATA	----------------------------	PARABASALEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Cells have from a few to thousands of flagella and aggregates of large Golgi bodies (parabasal bodies). Axostyleisskeletal, single, replicated, or lost; mitochondria are absent; gut symbionts. Trichomonadida has two to six flagella; a recurrent flagellum forms an undulating membrane; axostyle projects posteriorly to form the attachment site. Trichomonas and Mixotricha paradoxa in the termite gut have surface-attached spirochetes whose motion propels the flagellate. Hypermastigida has many flagella at the anterior end of the cell (sometimes also elsewhere). Most have surface-attached symbiotic bacteria. In the gut of termites and wood roaches. Barbulanympha, Lophomonas, Trichonympha. 
009	DINOFLAGELLATA	PROTOZOA	ALVEOLATA	DINOFLAGELLATA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	SUBPHYLUM	Approximately one-half of the 4000 marine and freshwater species of dinoflagellates have chloroplasts and are important primary producers, especially in the sea. The xanthophyll pigment peridinin colors themred-brown or golden brown.Their chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes and have chlorophylls a and c, but lack chlorophyll b. Dinoflagellate chloroplasts are diverse, having originated as endosymbionts from at least three different taxa of photosynthetic cells. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates lack plastids and are colorless. Like euglenoids, dinoflagellates originated as colorless heterotrophs that independency acquired chloroplasts by endosymbiosis, probably more than once. A few dinoflagellates are endoparasites of other protozoans, crustaceans, and fishes. The cell nucleus contains permanently condensed (thickened) chromo- somes having relatively small amounts of protein, and each chromosome is permanently attached to the nuclear membrane.

030	ACANTHAREA	PROTOZOA	ACTINOPODA	----------------------------	ACANTHAREA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Acanthareans are planktonic marine actinopods that superficially resemble radiolarians. The cell is a radially symmetric sphere from which project slender axopodia and 10 to 20 stout skeletal spines. The intracellular spines unite in the center of the medulla, radiate outward, and project beyond the periphery of the cell. Myonemes attach to the spine bases and, on contraction, expand the cortex to the tips of the spines. Acantharean spines are composed of strontium sulfate and not the silica of radiolarians. Strontium sulfate is soluble in seawater and, after cell death, the skeleton soon dissolves and leaves no trace either as a bottom ooze or in the fossil record. The cell is divided by a perforated organic test into a medulla and vacuolated cortex. The cortex is overlaid with a flexible extracellular cuticle. The medulla contains several nuclei and, often, zooxanthellae.

093	DIGENEA	BILATERIA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA	TREMATODA	DIGENEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	SUBCLADE	Digeneans, known as flukes, are common endoparasites of all major vertebrate taxa: fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Some flukes cause debilitating disease in livestock and humans. With some 11,000 species, more than all other flatworms combined, digeneans are second in diversity only to the roundworms (Nematoda) among metazoan parasites. 
094	ASPIDOGASTREA	BILATERIA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA	TREMATODA	ASPIDOGASTREA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	SUBCLADE	Aspidogastrea (or Aspidobothrea) is a small trematodetaxon with similarities to other parasitic flatworms, but more closely related to Digenea. The distinguishing trait is a huge adhesive organ, which is either a single, septate sucker covering the entire ventral surface or a longitudinal row of suckers.
095	MONOGENEA	BILATERIA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA	MONOGENEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	The approximately 1100 species of monogeneans are chiefly host-specific ectoparasites, or occasionally endoparasites, of aquatic vertebrates, especially fishes, but amphibians and reptiles are also hosts. Because most attach to the skin of a fast-moving host, monogeneans are dorsoventrally flattened and have a large, posterior attachment organ, the haptor, that bears hooks and suckers, allowing the parasite to cling tenaciously to the host.
096	CESTODA	BILATERIA	PLATYHELMINTHES	NEODERMATA	CESTODA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Cestoda is the most evolutionarily derived of the flatworm taxa, and all 3400 species are endoparasites of the gut of vertebrates. A gut is absent and the neodermis is highly specialized for nutrient uptake from the host. Most species of Cestoda occur in Eucestoda, which is described here.
097	ORTHONECTIDA	BILATERIA	ORTHONECTIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	PHYLUM	The 20-some species of orthonectids are endoparasites of turbellarians, nemerteans, polychaetes, gastropod and bivalve molluscs, brittle stars, and tunicates. The tiny adults, less than 1mm in length bear a series of epidermal ciliary rings that encircle the body. These rings alternate with rings of nonciliated cells in a species-specific fashion. The ciliary rootlets of adjacent cilia are interjoined in an intracellular network. A thin cuticle covers the body. Below the cuticle and epidermis are an extra cellular matrix and myocytes containing very thick, longitudinally oriented filaments composed of the protein paramyosin. Internal to the muscle sheath is a mass of gametes, either sperm or eggs. 
098	DICYEMIDA	BILATERIA	DICYEMIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	PHYLUM	The 75 species of dicyemids are delicate, slender worms that parasitise the kidneys of octopuses and cuttlefishes, but usually not squids. They occur, typically in high densities, in the renal sac and pericardial cavity, both of which are urine-containing compartments. One end of the parasite attaches to the nephridium’s absorptive lining while the body endocytoses low-molecular-weight nutrients from the primary urine. It thus competes with the reabsorptive epithelium of the nephridium (and host). 
099	PALAEONEMERTEA	BILATERIA	NEMERTEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	PALAEONEMERTEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	100 marine species.

110	MONOPLACOPHORA	BILATERIA	MOLLUSCA	----------------------------	MONOPLACOPHORA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Monoplacophorans resemble the generalized mollusc and are small, flattened, marine molluscs that inhabit deep water. Living representatives are 3 mm to little more than 3 cm long and are bilaterally symmetrical. They were known from Cambrian to Devonian fossils but were thought to be extinct until 1952, when 10 living specimens of Neopilina galatheae were dredged from a deep ocean trench off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Since this discovery, specimens belonging to about 20 species and three genera have been collected from waters 1800 to 7000 m deep in the northern and southern Atlantic, Indian, and eastern Pacific Oceans. The only known shallow-water species was found off the California coast at about 200 m. The modern species are thought to be the remnants of a formerly large and abundant taxon of molluscs.

114	CAENOGASTROPODA	BILATERIA	MOLLUSCA	CONCHIERA	GASTROPODA	PROSOBRANCHS	CAENOGASTROPODA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Includes the mesogastropods and neogastropods and thus most living prosobranchs. The great adaptive diversity of these two grades is in part due to the evolution of the monopectinate gill, which may have facilitated expansion from the ancestral rocky coasts into silty, especially soft-bottom, habitats. The dorsal and ventral membranes that suspend the archaeogastropod bipectinate gill are easily fouled by developed shell (Atlanta, Oxygyrus); Carinariidae has small sediment carried by the respiratory current.

169	ARENICOLIDEA	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	ARENICOLIDEA	FAMILY	Lugworms are common direct deposit feeders. Arenicola (and Abarenicold) lives in an L-shaped burrow that opens to the surface on the long side. The head of the worm is situated at the blind end of the horizontal part of the burrow, where sand is continually ingested by means of a simple pharynx. The ingested sand is rich in surface organic material, which tumbles into the surface depression above the animal’s head and slumps downward to the worm. Cilia in the everted pharynx drive loose particles into the gut, and some particle sorting occurs.
170	MALDANIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	MALDANIDAE	FAMILY	Bamboo worms, such as Clymenella and Axiothella, are deposit-feeding tube dwellers. Their sand-grain tubes, which resemble beverage straws, are common in the intertidal zone. Bamboo worms have wedge like heads; long, distinct segments and segment joints that have the appearance of bamboo cane and its joints; and parapodia reduced to low ridges. The worms live upside down in their tubes and ingest the substratum from below.
171	CAPITELLIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CAPITELLIDAE	FAMILY	Earthwormlike with reduced parapodia and no head appendages. Like earthworms, most feed on sediment as they burrow through it. Most capitellids are red because of abundant hemoglobin in the coelomic fluid. Pressurized coelomic fluid everts the thin-walled pharynx, which in living animals resembles a blood blister. Most capitellids are small, but one, the giant (80 cm) Notomastus lobatus (maitre d’worm), lives in clayey sediment along the southeastern coast of the United States. It occupies a permanent helical burrow that it shares with no fewer than eight species of commensals, including one scaleworm and two other polychaetes, three clams, acrab, and anamphipod. Capitella.
172	ORBINIIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORBINIIDAE	FAMILY	Earthwormlike in form and habits. They are often red or orange, depending on species. The prostomium lacks appendages. Proceeding from anterior to posterior along the body, the parapodia shift from lateral to dorsal. The eversible pharynx resembles that of capitellids, but orbiniids such as Orbinia ornata and Scoloplos rubra have paired comblike gills, derived from dorsal cirri, that arch over their backs.
173	OPHELIIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	OPHELIIDAE	FAMILY	Includes burrowers that ingest sediment with an eversible bulbous pharynx. They often have lateral gills, and sometimes lateral eyes. Some, such as Travisia, resemble short, fat, sluggish grubs. Ophelia and Armandia are fishlike, streamlined, and fast, being adapted to live in current-swept sand. They move like fish, too, swimming rapidly through either loose sand or water. Among other adaptations for swimming, their pygiclium is modified into a tail fin. They so closely resemble amphioxus (Chordata) that collectors often mistake the annelid for the chordate. Euzonus.
174	PHYLLODOCIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	PHYLLODOCIDAE	FAMILY	Paddleworms such as Eteone, Eulalia, and Phyllodoce have greatly flattened, paddlelike notopodia that are used as gills. Carnivores; actively crawl and seize prey with an eversible, muscular, unarmed pharynx. Eteone species find food by tracking the mucous trails laid down by prey on the surface of the mudflat.
175	TOMOPTERIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	TOMOPTERIDAE	FAMILY	Pelagic, transparent carnivores. Tomopteris is dorsoventrally flattened, lacks chaetae, and has very long cirri on segment.
176	ALCIOPIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ALCIOPIDAE	FAMILY	Pelagic, transparent carnivores. Vanadis and Rhynchonerella resemble paddleworms (Phyllodocidae), but have enormous, bulging eyes with which to locate prey.
177	NEREIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	NEREIDAE	FAMILY	Ragworms such as Nereis (and other genera) actively crawl, burrow, and occasionally swim. Pharynx is muscular, eversible, and has a pair of stout jaws. Head has two antennae, two palps, four eyes, and four pairs of tentacular cirri. Some, such as Nereispelagicct, Nereis virens, and Nereis diversicolor, are omnivores that feed on algae, other invertebrates, and even detritus. Nereis succinea and Nereis longissima feed primarily on detritus in the sediments. Nereisfucata, a commensal with the hermit crab, is carnivorous. Nereis brandti, of the northwest coast of the United States, reaches 1.8 m in length and feeds primarily on green algae. Ceratonereis, Platynereis.
178	GLYCERIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	GLYCERIDAE	FAMILY	Glycera (the bloodworm) and other genera occupy a subsurface gallery excavated in muddy bottoms. The gallery contains numerous loops that open to the surface. Lying in wait at the bottom of a loop, the worm uses its four tiny, vibration-sensitive antennae to detect surface movements of prey, such as small crustaceans. It then moves to the burrow opening and seizes the prey with its pharynx.
179	NEPHTYIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	NEPHTYIDAE	FAMILY	Similar to bloodworms (Glyceridae). Have a long, eversible pharynx, but only two jaws instead of four; carnivores of worms and small crustaceans. Nephtys and other nephtyids are called shimmy worms for their rapid, almost vibratory lateral undulations of the body while swimming or burrowing in loose sand; some- times called cat worms because the anterior prostomial margin bears two triangular palps that resemble a cat’s ears.
180	APHRODITIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	APHRODITIDAE	FAMILY	Scaleworms, called such because of two rows of overlapping scales on the dorsal surface resembling fish scales. Each scale is a highly modified dorsal cirrus called an elytron (pi., elytra) that is borne on a short stalk.   Because most live in tight quarters, the scales may channel the ventilating water current between the scales and body wall. Elytra also bear a variety of sensory structures. In the scaleworm Aphrodite (the sea mouse), the entire dorsal surface, including the elytra, is covered with hairlike “felt” composed of long notopodial chaetae that trail back over the dorsal surface of the animal. Scale worms are considered to be carnivores, but little is known about the feeding habits of commensal species. Aphroditidae: Aphrodite, Laetmonice; Polynoidae: Arctonoe, Halosynda, Harmothoe, Lepidasthenia, Lepidonotus; Polyodontidae: Polyodontes; Sigalionidae: Sthenelais. May also include Thalanessa.
181	POLYNOIDEA	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	POLYNOIDEA	FAMILY	Scaleworms, called such because of two rows of overlapping scales on the dorsal surface resembling fish scales. Each scale is a highly modified dorsal cirrus called an elytron (pi., elytra) that is borne on a short stalk. These scaleworms are secretive and occupy tight crevices beneath stones (polynoids)
182	POLYODONTIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	POLYODONTIDAE	FAMILY	Scaleworms, called such because of two rows of overlapping scales on the dorsal surface resembling fish scales. Each scale is a highly modified dorsal cirrus called an elytron (pi., elytra) that is borne on a short stalk.  a few scaleworms live in secreted tubes (polyodontids)
183	SIGALIONIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	SIGALIONIDAE	FAMILY	Scaleworms, called such because of two rows of overlapping scales on the dorsal surface resembling fish scales. Each scale is a highly modified dorsal cirrus called an elytron (pi., elytra) that is borne on a short stalk. A few scaleworms burrow (sigalionids).
184	HESIONIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	PHYLLODOCIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	HESIONIDAE	FAMILY	Active commensals or free living (Ophiodromus, Podarke) and a few tiny species in the interstitial habitat, the labyrinthine water-filled spaces between grains of sand. Of the latter, Hesionides crawls in typical polychaete fashion using parapodia, but interstitial polychaetes of Saccocirridae, Protodrilidae, Polygordiidae (Polygordius), and Diurodrilidae have lost the parapodia and rely on cilia for locomotion. Although previously classified as Archiannelida because of their simple body design (and small size), Diurodrilidae is now considered to be a member of Eunicida (discussed below), whereas the remaining families are tentatively placed within Canalipalpata (also discussed below).
185	MYZOSTOMIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	MYZOSTOMIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	MYZOSTOMIDAE	FAMILY	Commensals on sea lilies and feather stars or internal parasites of sea stars (Echinodermata). Myzostoma and relatives are little worms that rarely exceed 5 mm in length and superficially resemble flatworms, but when disturbed they scoot rapidly away on stubby legs, each one terminating in a hooked chaeta. Oval body is greatly flattened; five pairs of parapodia on the undersurfacc. Parapodia, chaetae, and segmented nervous system indicate that Myzostomida belongs to Polychaeta, but its sister taxon is unknown; placement in Aciculata is provisional.
186	EUNICIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	EUNICIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	EUNICIDAE	FAMILY	Members have a muscular, eversible pharynx that bears two stout mandibles and other accessory teeth. Includes the longest polychaete, Eunice aphroditois, a 3-m-long carnivorore from the tropical Indo-Pacific. Palola, some species of which are known as palolo worms, are famous for epitokal swarming and their savory flavor. Marphysa burrows in fine muddy sands, and Lysidice, like Palola, occurs in coralline rock.
187	AMPHINOMIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	EUNICIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	AMPHINOMIDAE	FAMILY	Mostly large, chiefly tropical, often beautifully colored, caterpillar-like fireworms are carnivores living on corals and driftwood, beneath stones, occasionally in sediment. Eat coral polyps, anemones, stalked barnacles, and other sessile invertebrates by prying them loose with a muscular lower lip and sucking them in whole. Goose barnacles (Lepas) ingested whole and later defecated as museum-quality barnacle shells. Fireworms are notorious for their defensive chaetae, which are uniquely calcified, brittle, and toxic. When bare skin brushes against the chaetae, they penetrate the skin, break free of the worm, and create a burning pain. Avoided by fish and experienced scuba divers. Amphinome, Chloeia, Eurythoe, Hermodice. 
188	ONUPHIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	EUNICIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ONUPHIDAE	FAMILY	Tube-dwelling aciculates; tubes are protective retreats and the occupants crawl actively within them by using well-developed parapodia. Diopatra, Onuphis, and Americonuphis build tough, conspicuous, membranous tubes that project vertically above the surface of the sand. The tube’s chimney is crooked and flared like a ship’s ventilator funnel. The chimneys are covered with bits of shell, seaweed, and other debris that the worm collects and positions with its jaws. Such ornamentation provides camouflage, and some worms graze on the algae planted on their own as well as their neighbors’ chimneys. 
189	SYLLIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	EUNICIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	SYLLIDAE	FAMILY	The tiny, abundant, diverse syllids are the polychaete answer to mosquitoes. They pierce prey with a pharyngeal tooth and then suck out the contents with a specialized, muscular part of the pharynx, the proventriculus. Mostly in shallow water and common on coral reefs, in fouling communities. Typical prey are hydroids, sponges, bryozoans, and other sessile invertebrates. Autolytus, Odontosyllis, Myrianida, Plakosyllis, Proceraea, Syllis, Typosyllis, Trypanosyllis, and many others. 
190	OENONIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	EUNICIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	OENONIDAE	FAMILY	Includes Arabella tricolor (the opalworm) and Drilonereis (the threadworms). Slender, often threadlike burrowers; some are direct deposit feeders, others are carnivores with well- developed pharyngeal jaws. Cuticle usually is glossy and iridescent. Curiously, juveniles of several species are endoparasites in the coelomic cavities of other polychaetes and echiurans. Labrorostratus.
191	LUMBRINERIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	EUNICIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	LUMBRINERIDAE	FAMILY	Slender burrowers with reduced head appendages, well-developed pharynx and jaws. Carnivores. Lumbrineris.
192	ICHTHYOTOMIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	EUNICIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ICHTHYOTOMIDAE	FAMILY	Ectoparasitic on eel fins. Ichthyotomus.
193	SPIONIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SPIONIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	SPIONIDAE	FAMILY	Tube-dwelling palp worms are either surface deposit feeders or suspension feeders; some may be both. Two long peristomial palps project from the tube opening and extend over the bottom. Particles that ad here to the surface are transported to the mouth in a ciliated channel along the length of each palp. Tubes of Spio, Scolelepis, and Streblospio generally are soft, straight, and cylindrical and have incorporated sand or mud, but the suspension-feeding Polydora bores into calcareous substrates, including the shells of living oysters, in which they form unsightly shell “blisters.” 
194	MAGELONIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SPIONIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	MAGELONIDAE	FAMILY	Shovel-headed borrowers that have a stiff, flat, spatulate prostomium that over hangs the mouth. The long peristomial palps are covered with short, sticky papillae that collect and pass deposited organic particles to the mouth. The threadlike worms are violet because of hemerythrin-containing hemocytes, unique among polychaetes. Magelonids such as Magelona are the only polychaetes with cross-striated muscles, the significance of which has yet to be determined.
195	CHAETOPRIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SPIONIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	CHAETOPRIDAE	FAMILY	Filter feeders that have straight (vertical) or U-shaped tubes partially buried in sand on protected beaches. Chaetopterus, Mesochaetopterus, Spiochaetopterus filter feed with one or more mucous nets suspended inside of the tube. As the water passes through, plankton are strained out and periodically the net and food are rolled up into a ball and swallowed.
196	TEREBELLIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	TEREBELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	TEREBELLIDAE	FAMILY	Spaghetti worms occupy tubes or simple vertical or U-shaped burrows in the sediment. Prostomial sensory appendages are absent, but clusters of highly extensible tentacles are borne on the head. Movement through the burrow usually is by peristaltic contractions. The parapodia are greatly reduced and are in part represented by transverse ridges provided with uncini, which grip the sides of the burrow. In terebellids such as Amphitrite, which occupies a U-shaped burrow, the hooks are oriented oppositely on the anterior and posterior ends of the animal. As a result, attempts to pull the worm from either the head or tail end of its burrow are opposed by the uncini. Other common genera include Lanice, Lysilla, Terebella, Thelepus.
197	AMPHARETIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	TEREBELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	AMPHARETIDAE	FAMILY	Ampharete and Melinna (spaghetti-mouth worms) are surface deposit feeders similar to terebellids that use extensible tentacles. Unlike terebellids, however, the tentacles originate from the roof of the mouth and can be withdrawn into it. Ampharetids occupy straight, vertical tubes, from which they emerge head first to feed on detritus.
198	CIRRATILIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	TEREBELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	CIRRATILIDAE	FAMILY	Fringed worms, such as Cirratulus and Cirriformia, are burrowers that deposit feed with a single pair, or two anterior clusters, of long feeding palps. A pair of long gill filaments, similar in appearance to the palps, occurs on each of many body segments. Dodecaceria.
199	PECTINARIIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	TEREBELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	PECTINARIIDAE	FAMILY	Amphictene, Cistenides, and Pectinaria (scaphopod like ice cream cone worms) construct a conical, one-layer-thick tube of cemented sand grains. The tube is open at its base and apex and the worm occupies it with its head at the broad basal end. Tube and worm are oriented head down in fine sand; the tube apex projects just above the sediment surface. Organics-rich sand is shoveled into the mouth with short, stout, golden chaetae (paleae), which together function as an operculum to close the tube aperture when the worm withdraws. Feces are released to the surface of the beach through the tube apex, which also provides an inlet for ventilating the gill surfaces.
200	FLABELLIGERIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	TEREBELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	FLABELLIGERIDAE	FAMILY	Burrowers with cephalic gills that can be retracted with the prostomium into the anterior segments. Extended gills and feeding palps are enclosed in a “cage” of long anterior chaetae. Cuticle has embedded sand grains. Hemocytes have chlorocruorin. Flabelligera, Piromis.
201	OWENIIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SABELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	OWENIIDAE	FAMILY	Owenia fusiformis (shingle-tube worm; builds a cylindrical tube of flat shell fragments incorporated into the organic tube fabric like overlapping roof tiles or shingles. The tube, head-end up, is oriented vertically in the beach and projects slightly above the sediment surface. The free edges of the shell shingles are oriented upward, making it difficult for a bird or current to dislodge the tube from the sand. The overlapping arrangement of the shell fragments also allows the tube to elongate, shorten, and bend as the worm within it moves. 
202	SABELLARIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SABELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	SABELLARIDAE	FAMILY	Sabellaria and Phragmatopoma (mason worms) build straight or curved cylindrical sand-grain tubes with walls more than one grain thick. The worms typically aggregate, sometimes by the millions, and cement their tubes together to form hard crusts or boulder-size mounds that resemble giant honeycombs. In warm-water areas such as the eastern coast of southern Florida and parts of England, these shallow-water structures form reefs that often are degraded by storms but quickly rebuilt. Anteriorly, two fused segments have grown forward and dorsally to form an operculum for blocking the tube entrance.
203	SABELLIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SABELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	SABELLIDAE	FAMILY	Among the most beautiful of the sedentary polychaetes are the fan worms, feather duster worms, or Christmas-tree worms. These families have prostomial palps that form a funnel shaped or spiral crown of from a few to many bipinnate tentacles called radioles; the side branches of each are the pinnules. The radioles are rolled up or folded together as the worm withdraws into its protective tube. Sabellids build membranous or sand-grain tubes. Because serpulids and spirorbids secrete calcareous tubes attached to rocks, shells, or algae, they can live protected on more or less exposed substrata.
204	SERPULIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SABELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	SERPULIDAE	FAMILY	Among the most beautiful of the sedentary polychaetes are the fan worms, feather duster worms, or Christmas-tree worms. These families have prostomial palps that form a funnel shaped or spiral crown of from a few to many bipinnate tentacles called radioles; the side branches of each are the pinnules. The radioles are rolled up or folded together as the worm withdraws into its protective tube. Sabellids build membranous or sand-grain tubes. Because serpulids and spirorbids secrete calcareous tubes attached to rocks, shells, or algae, they can live protected on more or less exposed substrata.
205	SPIRORBIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	SABELLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	SPIRORBIDAE	FAMILY	Among the most beautiful of the sedentary polychaetes are the fan worms, feather duster worms, or Christmas-tree worms. These families have prostomial palps that form a funnel shaped or spiral crown of from a few to many bipinnate tentacles called radioles; the side branches of each are the pinnules. The radioles are rolled up or folded together as the worm withdraws into its protective tube. Sabellids build membranous or sand-grain tubes. Because serpulids and spirorbids secrete calcareous tubes attached to rocks, shells, or algae, they can live protected on more or less exposed substrata.
206	POGONOPHORA	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	POLYCHAETA	POGONOPHORA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	SUBCLADE	The 80-plus species of beard worms are remarkable deepwater polychaetes associated with continental slopes and hydrothermal vents. All are slender (some threadlike), sedentary worms that occupy chitin-protein tubes. The smallest is approximately 5 cm in length and Riftia pachyptila of the Galapagos Rift is the giant, measuring up to 1.5 m in length and almost 4 cm in diameter.
207	AEOLOSOMATIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	CLITELLATA	OLIGOCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	AEOLOSOMATIDAE	FAMILY	Aeolosomci: small interstitial worms, usually less than 5 mm in length. Ventrally ciliated prostomium for gliding over and through substratum and for sweeping food particles into mouth. Chaetae on most segments, including anterior segments, but segmental septa are absent. One pair of testes and ovaries. Sexual reproduction is rare; clonal reproduction, by paratomy, is common. Encystment of adults occurs under adverse conditions. Although included here among oligochaetes, aeolosomatids may actually be polychaetes. The chief argument in favor of a polychaete alliance is the occurrence of nuchal organs on the prostomium (as “ciliated pits”), a polychaete autapomorphy. The brain of Aeolosoma is in the prostomium, as it is in polychaetes, not in an anterior segment. Aeolosoma also lacks a clitellum, the hallmark of clitellates.
208	NAIDIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	CLITELLATA	OLIGOCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	NAIDIDAE	FAMILY	Small, aquatic, predominantly freshwater oligohaetes similar to tubificids (below), but differing in living on submerged vegetation and having ocelli. Like the aeolosomatids, naidids have few segments, not more than 40. Prostomium lacks cilia, chaetae are absent from anterior segments, but segmental septa are present. Some have a long proboscis. As in aeolosomatids, there is one pair each of testes and ovaries; sexual reproduction has been infrequently observed. Paratomy is common: under ideal conditions, a new zooid is released every two or three days. Aulophorus: a pair of long gills on posterior end. Branchiura: a dorsal and a ventral gill filament on each posterior segment. Chaetogaster: a rudimentary prostomium, large mouth and large muscular pharynx for engulfing prey; carnivores of other worms, crustaceans, and insect larvae; parasites (in snails). Dero: makes sand-grain tubes and has small posterior gills. Stylaria: prostomium drawn out into a long process. Nais, Slavina.
209	TUBIFICIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	CLITELLATA	OLIGOCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	TUBIFICIDAE	FAMILY	Small to large, reddish burrowers in marine and freshwater sediments. The most common oligochaetes in deep freshwater sediments. Body composed of 40 to 200 distinctsegments, the number depending on species. Some, such as Tubifex, build and occupy vertical tubes from which they extend and wave their tails for gas exchange. Tubifex tubifex and Limnodrilus spp. thrive on organic pollution and tolerate low oxygen concentrations in the water. In highly polluted lakes and streams, tubificids are the only animals in the benthic sediments, where they form dense, waving beds. The marine Phallodrilus albidus lacks a gut and derives its nutrition in association with bacteria that oxidize reduced inorganic compounds. One pair of testes and one pair of ovaries; sexual reproduction is common, clonal reproduction is not.
210	LUMBRICILIDAE	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	CLITELLATA	OLIGOCHAETA	----------------------------	----------------------------	LUMBRICILIDAE	FAMILY	Freshwater worms, small (not exceeding 14 cm in length), but having many segments, each with four pairs of chaetae. Clonal reproduction by fragmentation dominates. The educationally useful California blackworm, Lumbriculus variegatus, is the best-known lumbriculid. In the laboratory, this easily cultured species, with its transparent body wall and rapid rate of asexual reproduction, is used to study functional morphology, regeneration, segment differentiation, locomotion, and other behaviors.

On crayfishes, some are ectoparasites on the gills, whereas others live on the exoskeletal surface and graze on organic debris and microorganisms. Often the crustacean’s head, carapace, and other parts are covered with these whitish worms. Chaetae, prostomium, and pygidium usually are absent. Body has 15 segments, the last forming a sucker. Head (peristomium plus three segments) is modified into a sucker with the mouth at its center. Buccalcavity contains two teeth, one dorsal and one ventral. Dorsal anus is on segment 14. Segmented coelom, more or less typical annelidan hemal system, two pairs of metanephridia. Hermaphrodites with internal fertilization. Zygotes deposited in cocoons attached to host.

217	PHARYNGOBDELLIFORMES	BILATERIA	ANNELIDA	----------------------------	CLITELLATA	----------------------------	ARHYNCHOBDELLIDA	PHARYNGOBDELLIFORMES	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Predatory, best known for the freshwater Erpobdella, with its long, nonprotrusible pharynx that occupies the anterior one-third of the body. Jaws are absent, but the muscular sucking pharynx, with its Y shaped lumen, enables these leeches to engulf large invertebrate prey. Dina. 
218	ECHIURIDAE	BILATERIA	ECHIURA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	ECHIURIDAE	FAMILY	Six species of Echiurus. Chaetae arranged in an anterior pair plus two rings around the posterior end of the trunk. Marine, in shallow temperate and tropical waters. 
219	URECHIDAE	BILATERIA	ECHIURA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	URECHIDAE	FAMILY	 Four species of Urechis. All construct U-shaped burrows through which water is pumped for gas exchange and filter feeding. Rudimentary prostomium assists in retrieval and ingestion of food-laden mucous net. Hemal system is absent. Anal water inhalation by cloaca and posterior intestine specialized for gas exchange. Two or three pairs of metanephridia in anterior trunk coelom. Trunk has an anterior pair of chaetae and a single posterior chaetal ring.
220	THALASSEMATIDAE	BILATERIA	ECHIURA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	THALASSEMATIDAE	FAMILY	Approximately 70 species of Thalassema, Lissomyema, Listriolobus, and Ochetosoma, and others; chiefly in warm water. Lack circle of anal chaetae, but have a pair of stout chaetal hooks on the anterior trunk. Ochetosoma has 4 or 5 segmental pairs of genital sacs and Ikedosoma pirotansis has up to 20, but most have 1 to 3 pairs. Thalassema hartmani: large spoon-worm on southeastern U.S. coast. Its burrow, like that of Urechis caupo, provides shelter and food for several commensals. Lissomyema mellita: southeastern U.S. coast, in tests of dead sand dollars and fissures in discarded mollusc shells; it enters the test when small and becomes too large to leave.

Sea of Japan.
223	SIPUNCULIDEA	BILATERIA	SIPUNCULA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	SIPUNCULIDEA	FAMILY	Tentacles encircle the mouth. Most burrow in marine sediments, but Phascolion strombus (hermit sipunculan) and similar species occupy discarded snail shells. In some species of Phascolion, but not P. strombus, the body is permanently coiled to fit the whorls of its shell. Sipunculus nudus: best-known sipunculan; wide- spread, large, robust; burrows actively in sand. Xenosiphon: external gills on trunk; Themiste: stalked, branched tentacles; shallow water.
224	PHASCOLOSOMATIDEA	BILATERIA	SIPUNCULA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	PHASCOLOSOMATIDEA	FAMILY	Tentacles dorsal to mouth, in an arc around the nuchal organ. (Associated ring canal still encircles the mouth, but is in dented dorsally, and nuchal organ is in that indentation; tentacles borne only on indented part of ring canal and thus are dorsal to the mouth.) Introvert usually bears a series of cuticular rings, each composed of tiny cat’s-claw-shaped hooks. Timestone (coral) borers Aspidosiphon and Lithacrosiphon both have well-developed anal shields (calcified in Lithacrosiphon) and a right-angled introvert (P araspidosiphon).

Some are large, and the American vinegaroon Mastigoproctus giganteus reaches 80 mm in length. The cephalothorax is completely covered by a carapace that bears a pair of anterior median eyes and three or four pairs of lateral eyes. Uropygid chelicerae are small and have two articles. The distal article forms a fang that folds against the large basal article. The large, raptorial pedipalps are stout and heavy, and short in comparison with the legs. The last two articles of the pedipalps may be modified to form a pincer used in seizing prey. During feeding, the prey is seized and torn apart by the pedipalps and then passed to the chelicerae. The animal holds its pedipalps and long, tactile first legs in front as it moves forward. The antenniform, sensory first legs touch the ground repeatedly.

265	ARGYRONETIDAE	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	ARANEAE	PALAEOBRIBELLATAE	ARGYRONETIDAE	FAMILY	One species. The Eurasian Argyroneta aquatica is the world’s only aquatic spider. Cursorial, lives and hunts beneath the water surface. Captures aquatic insects, then consumes them in a retreat consisting of an air bubble in a dome-shaped web. Air is replenished from the surface by bubbles trapped in abdominal hydrofuge pubescence.

270	PALPIGRADI	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	PALPIGRADI	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	The 70 known species of palpigrades are mostly less than 1.5 mm in length and none are larger than 3 mm. Microwhip scorpions are blind, interstitial soil arachnids occurring primarily in tropical and subtropical habitats but also in European subterranean environments. Many of their unusual characteristics, including their size, are adaptations for life in small spaces.
271	PSEUDOSCORPIONES	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	PSEUDOSCORPIONES	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	This taxon consists of small arachnids rarely exceeding 7mm in length and usually less than half that. Pseudoscorpions are widespread in leaf litter, under bark, in soil, and in moss and debris, where they are seldom noticed despite being very common. One species, Chelifer ccincroides, lives in human houses and is known as the book scorpion. About 2500 species are known worldwide. This distinct and homogeneous taxon has no close ties to other arachnids, except possibly the solifuges. Their resemblance to true scorpions is superficial and due solely to their common (convergent) possession of large chelate pedipalps. Pseudoscorpions move rapidly backward, although some also move forward and some, sideways. They exhibit a phenomenon known as phoresy, in which they grasp the leg of an insect with their pedipalps and hitch a ride as it flies to a new habitat.
272	SOLIFUGAE	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	SOLIFUGAE	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Solifuges form a taxon of about 800 to 1000 tropical and semi tropical arachnids, sometimes called sun spiders because of their spider like appearance and diurnal habits or wind spiders because of the great speed of the males. In the United States, a few species have been found in Florida and more than 100 have been found in the southwest, some as far north as Colorado. Many solifuges are common in warm, arid regions of the world, but they are also known from grasslands and forests. Solifuges hide under stones and in crevices and many dig burrows. Their length ranges from a few millimeters to as much as 7 cm. The cephalothorax is covered dorsally by a large anterior carapace bearing a pair of closely placed median eyes on the anterior border and a short posterior carapace, or tergum. The hinge between the anterior and posterior carapaces is flexible. The segmented abdomen is large and joined to the cephalothorax by a slightly narrowed waist. 
273	OPILIONES	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	OPILIONES	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Opiliones, or Phalangida, contains the familiar long-legged arachnids known as daddy longlegs or harvestmen. The 5000 or more described species live in temperate and tropical climates and most prefer humid habitats. Harvestmen are abundant in vegetation, on the forest floor, on tree trunks and fallen logs, in humus, and in caves. They do not produce silk or toxins and they do not bite, although they may (rarely) pinch. The widespread belief that harvestmen have a highly toxic venom is due to their being confused with pholcid spiders, which also go by the name “daddy longlegs.” These spiders resemble harvestmen but have a potent toxin, although their chelicerae are too small and weak to envenomate humans. Most harvestmen are predators but, unlike almost all other arachnids, many are herbivores, and many feed on dead organic material. Also unlike other arachnids, they are capable of ingesting particulate food. In fact, since the pharynx pedipalps and passed to the chelicerae, which hold and crush it. Unlike other arachnids, the ingested food is not limited to liquid material, but includes small particles. Thus, a greater part of digestion must take place in the midgut. The mouth is preceded by the preoral cavity, which is bounded dorsally by the labrum, ventrally by the labium, and laterally by the gnathobases of the pedipalps and first legs.
274	RICINULEI	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	RICINULEI	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Ricinulei includes about 75 species of small, uncommon arachnids known as tick spiders found in Africa (Ricinoides) and the Americas (Cryptocellus) from Brazil to the southern United States, where they have been collected from leaf litter and in caves. Ricinuleids are heavy-bodied and small, measuring up to 10 mm in length. The cuticle is very thick, heavily sclerotized, and often sculptured. Attached to the anterior margin of the carapace is a unique, hoodlike cucullus that can be raised and lowered. When lowered, it covers the preoral cavity, mouth, and chelicerae. Ricinuleids are blind, but Tiave lateral light-sensitive spots. Unlike the three-part chelicerae of the Acari (mites), tick spider chelicerae have only two articles. The pedipalps are chelate, the second legs are sensory, and the male third legs are used to transfer sperm to the female gonopore. The cephalothorax and 10-segment abdomen are broadly joined. The anterior abdominal segments are wide, but the posterior segments are small and telescoping, with the anus on the 10th segment. 
275	OPILIOACARIDA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	ACARI	OPILIOACARIDA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Large, rare, leathery, primitive mites. Segmented abdomen. Trichobothria are absent. Resemble opilionids. Live in leaf litter and beneath stones. Omnivorous or predatory; ingest solid food. Feed on millipedes, opilionids, mites, pollen.

276	ACARIFORMES	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	ACARI	ACARIFORMES	----------------------------	SUBORDER	The“mitelike” mites.The most diverse mite taxon, with over 30,000 species. Indirect development. Setae have optically active, birefringent actinochitin. Trichobothria are present. Includes Astigmata, Endeostigmata, Oribatida, Sarcoptiformes, and Trombidiformes (Prostigmata). Belba, Demodex, Dermatophagoides, Mideopsis, Neotrombicula, Sarcoptes, Tetranychus, Trombicula, Trombidium, Tydeus. 
277	PARASITIFORMES	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CHELICERATA	ARACHNIDA	----------------------------	ACARI	PARASITIFORMES	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Ticks and related mites in about 75 families. Setae have no actinochitin. Trichobothria and coxae are absent. Ventral anal aperture covered by sclerotized plates. Cuticularized ring around gnathosoma. Includes Mesostigmata (many parasitic species), Holothyrida (large, armored mites), and Ixodida (ticks: large, hematophagous, have vertebrate hosts). Caminella, Dermacentor, Ixodes.
278	REMIPEDIA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	REMIPEDIA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	The first known remipede, Speleonectes lucayensis, was described in 1981 and the taxon is now represented by 10 species in six genera, all from under sea caves primarily in the Bahamas, West Indies, and Yucatan Peninsula. So far, all representatives have been found in water filled caves connecting with the sea at one end and with freshwater ponds at the other. The body of these 15- to 45-mm-long marine crustaceans is elongate, resembling that of a polychaete, with numerous biramous appendages. Powerful rowing strokes of the trunk appendages produce rhythmic preferred by MW waves that sweep along the length of the body for swimming. Remipedes are carnivores or scavengers. The body includes a trunk and a cephalothorax, the latter of which is covered by a sclerotized carapace (cephalic shield). Eyes do not seem to be present, although sometimes there are vestigial eye like structures. Suppression or loss of eyes is a common adaptation in cave dwelling animals. The large first antennae are biramous and bear chemosensory aesthetascs. The much smaller second antennae are paddlelike. 
279	CEPHALOCARIDA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	CEPHALOCARIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Cephalocarids conform closely to the hypothesized ancestral crustacean in that they are epibenthic deposit feeders with undifferentiated trunk appendages. The nine known species have been collected in sand and mud from the high subtidal to depths of 1550 m in many parts of the world. The first was found in Long Island Sound in 1953. Cephalocarids are tiny crustaceans of less than 4 mm in length. 
280	ANOSTRACA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	ANOSTRACA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	This relatively small taxon inhabits inland, but not necessarily fresh, waters. Anostraca includes the fairy and brine shrimps, both of which are confined to relictual habitats from which fishes are excluded either because the habitat dries up periodically or because the water is too saline. Brine shrimps, whose eggs are creatively marketed with the claim they will hatch into “sea monkeys,” are familiar to many people.
281	NOTOSTRACA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	PHYLLOPODA	----------------------------	NOTOSTRACA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Notostraca consists of only 10 species of benthic tadpole shrimps in the genera Triops and Lepidurus that are found in quiet, inland, fish-free waters. Notostracans resemble anostracans in some respects, but the similarities are now thought to be superficial and due to convergence. The body consists of ahead, thorax, and abdomen, with no secondary tagmosis. An enormous depressed, shieldlike carapace covers the head, thorax, and most of the abdomen. Sessile compound eyes are present on the anterior carapace. The mandibles are large and triturative.
282	LAEVICAUDATA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	PHYLLOPODA	----------------------------	LAEVICAUDATA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	These two taxa with several superficial similarities were formerly grouped together in Gonchostraca, or clam shrimps, but are no longer thought to belong to a monophyletic taxon. Nevertheless, it is still convenient to refer to them unofficially as “conchostraca.” The 200 extant described species are characterized by the large, bivalved carapace that encloses the entire body so that, when viewed from the outside, the animal resembles a small clam. The carapace is laterally compressed, unlike that of notostracans, and equipped with a strong transverse adductor muscle.
283	SPINICAUDATA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	PHYLLOPODA	----------------------------	SPINICAUDATA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	These two taxa with several superficial similarities were formerly grouped together in Gonchostraca, or clam shrimps, but are no longer thought to belong to a monophyletic taxon. Nevertheless, it is still convenient to refer to them unofficially as “conchostraca.” The 200 extant described species are characterized by the large, bivalved carapace that encloses the entire body so that, when viewed from the outside, the animal resembles a small clam. The carapace is laterally compressed, unlike that of notostracans, and equipped with a strong transverse adductor muscle.
284	ANOMOPODA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	PHYLLOPODA	----------------------------	CLADOCERA	ANOMOPODA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Trunk is short and enclosed by a well-developed, hingeless, laterally compressed, bivalve carapace. Head is expanded dorsally and laterally to form a head shield. Trunk is short, its segments fused. Five or six pairs of dissimilar trunk appendages which do not beat in metachronal waves. Postabdomen reflexed anteriorly under trunk. Postabdomen has a pair of long setae and a pair of large terminal claws. Development is direct; hatch as miniature adults. Resting eggs enclosed in ephippium derived from the carapace. Freshwater. Nine families including Bosminidae, Chydoridae, Daphniidae, Macrothricidae, and Moinidae. The majority of cladocerans are anomopods. Alona, Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia, Chydorus, Daphnia, Macrothrix, Moina, Scapholeberis.
285	CTENOPODA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	PHYLLOPODA	----------------------------	CLADOCERA	CTENOPODA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Similar to anomopods. Short trunk is enclosed by well-developed, laterally compressed, bivalve carapace lacking a true hinge. No head shield. Six pairs of similar trunk appendages beat in rhythmic waves. Post abdomen has a pair of long setae and a pair of large terminal claws. Development is direct; hatch as miniature adults. Chiefly freshwater, but one marine genus. Two families, Holopediidae and Sididae. Holopedium, Sida. 
286	ONYCHOPODA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	PHYLLOPODA	----------------------------	CLADOCERA	ONYCHOPODA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Do not closely resemble anomopods or ctenopods. Head and trunk are short. Carapace is reduced, represented only by dorsal brood pouch; does not enclose trunk. Development is direct. Freshwater, marine predators. Trunk appendages raptorial, adapted for grasping rather than filtering. Includes Cercopagidae, Podonidae, Polyphemidae. Bythotrephes, Evadne, Podon, Polyphemus. 
287	HAPLOPODA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	PHYLLOPODA	----------------------------	CLADOCERA	HAPLOPODA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Very different from other cladocerans. Elongate head and body. Carapace is a dorsal brood pouch in females, absent in males. Freshwater zooplanktivores. Much larger than other cladocerans, up to 18 mm. Anterior trunk.appendages are raptorial and adapted for grasping smaller zooplankters. Development indirect, hatching stage is a metanauplius. Leptodoridae the only family, Leptodora kindtii the only species. 
288	LEPTOSTRACA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	LEPTOSTRACA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Leptostracans, or phyllocarids, are small, benthic marine malacostracans. They look like tiny shrimps enclosed in an enormous carapace. About 20 species occur worldwide and range in length from 10 to 40 mm. Except for a single planktonic species, all are benthic and found from the intertidal to the deep sea. Species of Nebalia occur in mud and seaweed on the both coasts of North America.
289	STOMATOPODA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	STOMATOPODA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	The 300 species of marine crustaceans known as mantis shrimps constitute Stomatopoda. Mantis shrimp are highly specialized predators of fishes, crabs, shrimps, and molluscs, and many of their distinctive features are related to their raptorial behavior. The dorsoventrally depressed body is divided into a head, thorax, and abdomen and there is no cephalothorax. The head bears a pair of large, stalked compound eyes and a single median naupliar eye. The first antennae are unusual in being triramous, with three flagella. Each second antenna consists of a peduncle, flagellum, and large antennal scale. Dorsally, a shieldlike carapace covers the head and first four thoracic segments. A movable median rostrum articulates with the anterior edge of the carapace and covers the bases of the eyestalks.
290	DECAPODA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	DECAPODA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Decapoda includes shrimps, crayfishes, lobsters, and crabs and are certainly the most familiar crustaceans. Most decapods are large and many are edible and support important fisheries. The approximately 10,000 described species represent about one-quarter of the known crustaceans. Because of their large size, abundance, and ecological and economic importance, decapods are the most carefully studied and best-known crustaceans. Most are marine and benthic, but the crayfishes and some shrimps and crabs have invaded fresh water A few crabs are terrestrial and some decapods are planktonic.
291	ANASPIDACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	SYNCARIDA	ANASPIDACEA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Anaspidaceans are shrimp like syncaridans with many primitive characteristics. Segments and appendages are only moderately specialized. The first thoracic segment bears maxillipeds and is fused with the head to form a small cephalothorax, but there is no carapace. The remaining thoracic appendages are similar to each other. The abdomen consists of six segments with up to five pairs of pleopods. Pleopods 1 and 2 of the male are intromittent organs, and fertilization is internal. The telson and a pair of uropods are on the sixth abdominal segment. Anaspidaceans inhabit relictual fresh-water habitats where there are few or no predators. They are found in caves, streams, and lakes in Tasmania, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Several live in crayfish burrows and many inhabit lacustrine vegetation beds. Anaspidaceans are suspension feeders or omnivores, and the largest is 5 cm in length.
292	BATHYNELLACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	SYNCARIDA	BATHYNELLACEA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Bathynellaceans are elongate, blind, interstitial or groundwater syncaridans. Most occur in fresh water or, in a few instances, brackish water. Thermobathynella occurs in hot springs at temperatures of up to 55°C. The body is small and vermiform with reduced appendages, as is characteristic of interstitial animals. The tagmata are a head, thorax, and abdomen with no secondary tagmosis. The thorax consists of eight segments, but none is fused with the head. Cephalothorax, maxillipeds, and carapace are absent. Thoracic appendages 1 through 7 are similar and biramous. The eighth thoracopod is reduced or absent. The last of the six abdominal segments is fused with the telson to form a pleotelson. Abdominal appendages, with the exception of a pair of uropods on the pleotelson, are reduced or absent. 
293	EUPHAUSIACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	SYNCARIDA	EUPHAUSIACEA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Euphausiaceans, or krill, are pelagic crustaceans approximately 3 cm in length. All 85 described species are marine. Like primitive decapods, krill have a shrimplike body with a highly developed carapace fused with all thoracic segments. Unlike the decapods, however, the euphausiacean carapace does not extend ventrally beyond the bases of the legs. It does not form a branchial chamber and the gills are exposed. The thoracic legs are biramous and the gills are filamentous epipods on the protopod. The thoracic exopods move rhythmically to ventilate the gills. Although there are eight pairs of thoracic appendages, the eighth, and sometimes the seventh, are reduced. The second pair of thoracopods may be raptorial in carnivorous species, but maxillipeds are absent. Pleopods, uropods, and telson resemble those of shrimps.
294	THERMOSBAENA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	PANCARIDA	THERMOSBAENA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	The only higher-level pancaridan taxon, Thermosbaenacea, consists of about 35 subterranean species from hot springs, caves, and ground water and a few from coastal marine interstitial habitats. Thermosbaenaceans are small crustaceans of only a few millimeters in length. Morphology is variable, but the head is fused with one thoracic segment, producing a small cephalothorax and a pereon of seven segments. The small carapace is fused with the first thoracic segment and covers a variable number of additional segments. In females the carapace is expanded to form a dorsal brood pouch. There are no oostegites. The first thoracopod is a maxilliped, and most pereopods are biramous. Pleopods are present only on the anterior abdominal segments and segment 6 bears the uropods and telson. Thermosbaenaceans are detritivores that swim upside down using the pereopods. The carapace is the chief respiratory surface and the very short heart has only one pair of ostia. Nephridia are unknown. Fertilization is probably internal.
295	MYSIDACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	PERACARIDA	MYSIDACEA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Mysidaceans are small, shrimphke peracarids of freshwater, brackish, and marine habitats. Most are 2 to 30 mm in length, but the bathypelagic Gnathophausia may reach 35 cm. Some are important members of northern lakes, but most are marine; they may be benthic or pelagic. 
296	GAMMARIDEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	PERACARIDA	AMPHIPODA	GAMMARIDEA	FAMILY	The largest amphipod taxon, Gammaridea, includes about 5000 of the 6000 amphipod species. These are the “typical” amphipods most like the stem amphipod. Gammarideans usually are laterally compressed, although some are dorsoventrally depressed. Most are benthic and usually remain closely associated with the bottom despite being capable of swimming. Typical gammarideans have large coxal plates, a large abdomen with six pairs of appendages, and relatively small compound eyes. The first thoracic segment is fused with the head to form a cephalothorax.
297	HYPERIIDEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	PERACARIDA	AMPHIPODA	HYPERIIDEA	FAMILY	Hyperiidea is a taxon of about 500 species of pelagic marine amphipods. What little is known of their life histories suggests that all hyperiideans spend at least part of the life cycle as commensals or parasites of gelatinous zooplankters such as salps, siphonophores, jellyfishes, and ctenophores. For example, members of Phronimidae live in the barrel-shaped tunic of salps, which they propel through the water. 
298	CAPRELLIDEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	PERACARIDA	AMPHIPODA	CAPRELLIDEA	FAMILY	Species of the aptly named skeleton shrimps are highly derived, strictly marine benthic amphipods adapted for a life of clinging to complex substrata such as sea weeds, bryozoans, and hydroids. Most are lie-in-wait predators of small invertebrates, but some consume epiphytic diatoms. There are about 350 extant described species. The body, which bears little resemblance to that of other amphipods, is elongate, sticklike, cylindrical, and not laterally compressed. The second thoracic segment is partially fused with the head to create a cephalothorax consisting of the head plus two thoracic segments. The first thoracic appendages are maxillipeds, as usual, but those of the second remain gnathopods. The third thoracic segment bears the second pair of gnathopods. Thoracic segments 4 and 5 bear slender, reduced or vestigial pereopods, gills, and, infemales, largeoostegites. The marsupium is thus restricted to the middle of the thorax on the fourth and fifth thoracic segments. Thoracic appendages 6 through 8 are well-developed, subchelate prehensile legs used to cling tenaciously to the substratum. Coxae are reduced or vestigial. The abdomen consists of five small segments with vestigial appendages.
299	INGOLFIELLIDEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	PERACARIDA	AMPHIPODA	INGOLFIELLIDEA	FAMILY	Ingolfiellideans, some of which are less than 1 mm long, are adapted for interstitial habitats in both marine and freshwater environments. The body is cylindrical and the thorax and abdomen are well developed. The pleopods are vestigial, but the first two pairs of uropods are strong. The 30 known species occur in hypogean (subterranean), interstitial, and deep-sea habitats. Their small size, loss of eyes and pigmentation, vermiform shape, and reduced appendages are familiar adaptations for life in interstitial habitats. Ingolfiella. 
300	CUMACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	CUMACEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Cumaceans are small inhabitants of sand and mud bottoms. The taxon is small, with about 800 species of distinctively tadpole-shaped and easily recognized marine peracaridans. Most are about 1 mm in length, and the largest is about 4 mm. They reach their greatest diversity and ecological significance in the deep sea.
301	MICTACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	MICTACEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Mictacea was described in 1985 and is now known from two small, subcylindrical species: Hirsutia bathyalis from 1000 m in the North Atlantic and South Pacific and Mictocarishalope from Bermudan sea caves. The largest is 3.5 mm in length. The first thoracomere is fused with the head and its appendages are maxillipeds. The carapace covers only the first thoracomere. The seven pereopods are biramous with setose exopods used primarily for swimming. Oostegites are present on most pereopods of females and form a marsupium. The six-segmented abdomen bears reduced pleopods on its first five segments and well-developed uropods and a telson on the sixth. Mictaceans probably are detritivores, but little is known of their biology. 
302	SPELAEOGRIPHACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	SPELAEOGRIPHACEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	This small taxon of subterranean peracaridans includes only three known species: Spelaeogriphus lepidops from Bat Cave in Table Mountain, South Africa; the Brazilian Potiicoara brasiliensis; and Mangkurtu mityula from Western Australia. The body is long and cylindrical and may reach up to 9 mm in length. The head thoracomere is fused with the head and bears maxillipeds. A small carapace extends posteriorly to cover the second thoracomere and part of the third. Most of the seven pereopods are biramous and their exopods are gills. Females have oostegites on the first five pereopods. The abdomen has six segments and the biramous, setose pleopods are mostly well developed and natatory, although the fifth is vestigial. The uropods are biramous. The biology and internal anatomy are poorly known.
303	TANAIDACEA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	MALACOSTRACA	----------------------------	TANAIDACEA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Tanaidaceans are small, marine, benthic crustaceans. Most of the approximately 700 described species are only 2 to 5 mm in length, although one reaches 12 cm. The body is elongate and cylindrical or depressed in cross section. The head is fused with the first two thoracic segments to form a cephalothorax, which is covered by a carapace. The appendages of the head thoracic segment form a maxilliped whereas those of the second are chelipeds, which may be very large. Chelipeds on the second thoracic segment are a distinctive feature of tanaidaceans. The remaining six thoracic segments form the pereon and their appendages are pereopods.

Eventually the larvae pupate and emerge as adults, which then infest the host. Ctenocephalides, Orchopeas, Pulex.
363	STREPSIPTERA	BILATERIA	ANTHROPODA	CRUSTACEA	INSECTA 	EUMETABOLA	STREPSIPTERA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	These tiny, bizarre insects are, as females and larvae, parasites on a variety of other insects. Females usually are larva-like, wingless, and never leave the host. They live embedded in the host’s integument, with only their anterior end, with spiracles, protruding as a low bump above the host’s exoskeleton. Nutriment from the host’s blood is absorbed directly across the permeable cuticle of the parasite’s embedded abdomen. In contrast, males have large, unusual, fanlike hind wings. The forewings are reduced to club-shaped, haltere-like appendages that may have a role in balance, and the hind wings are large. Adult males are short-lived, nonparasitic, and do not feed. Male’s com- pound eyes are large, protruding. Antennae typically have processes extending from the flagellum. Eoxenos, Halictophagus, Stylops, Triozocera.

Compound eyes are large, well developed. Functional, membranous forewings; reduced, knoblike hind wings (halteres). Mouthparts are variable, but basically are suctorial or sponging; used in conjunction with a cibarial pump. Almost all adult flies feed on plant or animal fluids. In many taxa known collectively as biting flies, females suck blood from vertebrate hosts, usually birds or mammals. Adults so frequently are vectors of human and animal diseases that this is the most important hexapod order in terms of human health. Larvae are maggots and are always found in wet substrata such as flesh, fruit, water, or mud. Females typically oviposit in a suitable moist food source for the larvae, which then live in their food as they consume it.

441	BOURGUETICRINIDA	BILATERIA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA	CRINOIDEA	----------------------------	BOURGUETICRINIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Have a slender stalk that ends in an attachment base and lacks cirri. Conocrinus.
442	COMATULIDA	BILATERIA	ECHINODERMATA	ELEUTHEROZOA	CRINOIDEA	----------------------------	COMATULIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	Ranges from shallow water to great depths. Stalk is present only in pentacrinoid stage, absent in adult, which has grasping cirri and can swim with the arms. Six hundred species of Antedon, Comactinia, and Florometra, among others.
443	CEPHALOCHORDATA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	CEPHALOCHORDATA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	SUBPHYLUM	The 30 described species of cephalochordates are glossy slivers that swim rapidly and slip through sand or fingers like tiny eels. Also known as lancelets, or amphioxus, these small, fish-like chordates occur in tropical and temperate oceans world- wide. Unlike most fish, however, lancelets burrow in porous intertidal or shallow subtidal sand and rarely emerge to swim in the water. While in their burrows, they expose the mouth to water at the sediment surface and filter out suspended food particles. Although widespread globally, their patchy local distributions are influenced by sediment suitability and the abundance of phytoplankton food. When these conditions are met, lancelet populations can be impressive. For example, Branchiosioma caribaeum occurs in densities of up to 5000 individuals per m2 of sand in Discovery Bay, Jamaica.
444	APPENDICULARIA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	TUNICATA	APPENDICULARIA	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	----------------------------	CLADE	Most of the 70 species of Appendicularia are tiny filter-feeding tadpoles that abound in the surface and midwater plankton of the world’s oceans. Under ideal conditions, their numbers may be astronomical: 25,620 individuals of Oikopleura dioica percubic meter of water were reported from British Columbia. The name Appendicularia refers to their tail, which persists throughout the life of the animal. The alternative name, Larvacea, indicates their resemblance to the tadpole larva of ascidians. Appendicularians are the only tunicates to have all the key chordate characteristics as adults.
445	PYROSOMIDA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	TUNICATA	THALIACEA	----------------------------	PYROSOMIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	The 10 species of tropical pyrosomes are brilliantly luminescent colonies in the form of a hollow tube closed at one end. The colony length ranges from a few centimeters (as in Pyrosoma atlanticum) to over 20 m (as in Pyrostremma spinosum). The zooids are embedded in the wall (common tunic)of the tube, similar to the zooids of a compound ascidian.
446	DOLIOLIDA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	TUNICATA	THALIACEA	----------------------------	DOLIOLIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	The 23 species of doliolids have barrel-shaped zooids ranging in size from 1 to 50 mm. The body-wall muscles are eight or nine hooplike bands around the circumference of the body. Contraction of these cross-striated muscles results in ajet thrust from the atrial siphon. Backflow through the buccal siphon, at the opposite end of the body, is prevented by a one way valve. Although this muscular pumping is responsible for locomotion, the filter feeding current is generated by gill slit cilia, as it is in ascidians and pyrosomes.
447	SALPIDA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	TUNICATA	THALIACEA	----------------------------	SALPIDA	----------------------------	----------------------------	ORDER	The 40-some species of salps have prism-shaped zooids with hooplike muscles, like doliolids, but some adjacent muscle bands are partly fused. The zooids range in size from a few millimeters to 4 cm (as in Salpafusiformis). The muscle bands of salps pump water forjet propulsion and, uniquely, also for biter feeding. The salp pharynx is peculiar in having only a single mid-dorsal gill bar and no side walls. 
448	APLOUSOBRANCHIA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	TUNICATA	ASCIDIACEA	----------------------------	ENTEROGONA	APLOUSOBRANCHIA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Colonial, primarily compound species. Epicardia and sometimes a post abdomen are present. Clavelina (light bulb tunicates) zooids are not compound, but inteijoined at bases.
449	PHLEBOBRANCHIA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	TUNICATA	ASCIDIACEA	----------------------------	ENTEROGONA	PHLEBOBRANCHIA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Colonial or solitary, with or without an epicardium, lack a post abdomen. Lining of phlebobranch pharynx is either flat or undulating. Numerous raised papillae that protrude from the trans- verse pharyngeal vessels help to support the mucous feeding net and may improve water flow through it.
450	STOLIDOBRANCHIA	BILATERIA	CHORDATA	TUNICATA	ASCIDIACEA	----------------------------	PLEUROGONA	STOLIDOBRANCHIA	----------------------------	SUBORDER	Solitary or colonial. Pharyngeal lining is highly pleated with both transverse and longitudinal vessels. Gill-slit number varies with body size. Molgulidae has renal sacs and numerous spiral gill slits.
